## On the Genesis of Igneous Rocks and of Meteorites.

### § 1. Plankton.

A few months ago I published a pamphlet entitled "The Nummulosphere,"* giving an account of a discovery I had made that igneous rocks, Eozoon, and numerous limestones from Cretaceous to Precambrian were mainly composed of very small nummulite shells. Further I had found organic structure of the same kind in meteorites.

*) Sold by Lamley & Co., 1, Exhibition Road, London, S.W. Price two shillings. A third part on Stromatoporoids, chalk, igneous rocks, _etc._, with illustrations will appear shortly.

Not merely were my statements concerning igneous rocks discredited, but the book was regarded by some as the freak of a "crank" or of an insane person.

There was, perhaps, some justification for scepticism, for it is not always easy for a beginner to detect the nummulites in the limestones and igneous rocks. At the same time I fail to understand how a careful observer using a good x10 lens can miss seeing that the weathered surface of chalk or the roughened surface of many flints is made up of disks each with a pattern of concentric circles (really spirals) enclosing extremely fine squarish meshes.

I was told that it was impossible for any trace of organic structure to survive in rocks that had been molten. Again, if the igneous rocks had once been masses of limestone thousands of feet thick, how could they have become silicated, and where had all the lime gone to?

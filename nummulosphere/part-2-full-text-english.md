## On the Genesis of Igneous Rocks and of Meteorites.

### § 1. Plankton.

A few months ago I published a pamphlet entitled "The Nummulosphere,"* giving an account of a discovery I had made that igneous rocks, Eozoon, and numerous limestones from Cretaceous to Precambrian were mainly composed of very small nummulite shells. Further I had found organic structure of the same kind in meteorites.

*) Sold by Lamley & Co., 1, Exhibition Road, London, S.W. Price two shillings. A third part on Stromatoporoids, chalk, igneous rocks, _etc._, with illustrations will appear shortly.

Not merely were my statements concerning igneous rocks discredited, but the book was regarded by some as the freak of a "crank" or of an insane person.

There was, perhaps, some justification for scepticism, for it is not always easy for a beginner to detect the nummulites in the limestones and igneous rocks. At the same time I fail to understand how a careful observer using a good x10 lens can miss seeing that the weathered surface of chalk or the roughened surface of many flints is made up of disks each with a pattern of concentric circles (really spirals) enclosing extremely fine squarish meshes.

I was told that it was impossible for any trace of organic structure to survive in rocks that had been molten. Again, if the igneous rocks had once been masses of limestone thousands of feet thick, how could they have become silicated, and where had all the lime gone to?

It is now possible to give a satisfactory answer to some of these questions.

Recently when examining a section of _Eozoon canadense_ under a high power I found a well-formed Radiolarian skeleton embedded in the olivine. I did not at the moment realize the full significance of this discovery, for I had become thoroughly familiar with the idea that a specimen of Eozoon was a fragment of an ancient sea-bottom, and I knew that L. Cayeux had already described and figured Radiolaria from rocks of Precambrian age in Brittany (Bull. Soc. Geol. France 1894, 3. xxii., p. 197, pl. xi.). A day or two later, I found in the same section the representatives of several genera of Radiolaria. It then occurred to me to examine sections of plutonic rocks. Almost immediately I found a considerable number of Radiolaria in Swedish, Aberdeen and Cornish granites, and a little later specimens of diatoms resembling species of _Synedra_ and _Navicula_.

These objects are best seen under the highest powers (2 millim. apochromatic, Oc. 18. 2400 diameters), and in a dim light. A strong light "drowns" the outlines of the skeletons.

In sections of granite the skeletons of Radiolaria can often be seen melting away, so to speak, into the homogeneous quartz, which is very probably wholly composed of the siliceous skeletons of unicellular organisms that have rained down on to the nummulitic reefs.

Recent researches of petrologists, especially of Hatschek, and of Liesegang (Geologische Diffusionen) have shown how mineral substances diffuse out from some centre into the surrounding rock, the diffusion and chemical change being much aided by heat.

In granite (or the granular rock) the little masses of siliceous skeletons which had been peppered down on to the reefs became centres whence the silex diffused itself around. The silex became silicated to the extent to which bases where available for union with the feeble silicic "acid," the bases usually present being compounds of metals of the alkalies (K, Na.) of the alkaline earths (Ca, Mg.) and of the earths (Aluminium). Thus feldspar, mica, horneblende, _etc._, were formed, the residual silex remaining as quartz. Various compounds of iron are very common, the pure metal only rarely being found, as in the Ovifak specimens and in siderites. The iron in these cases has almost certainly been reduced from iron salts which had infiltrated the silicated nummulitic reefs, for indubitable traces of organic structure still persist both in the Ovifak specimens and in siderites.

Generally all the carbonate of lime disappeared probably partly by solution in carbonic acid and water, though some of the calcium was retained in certain members of the pyroxene group of minerals.

The extent to which vast accumulations of lime can disappear is seen in the oceanic deposit known as Barbados Earth. This formation attains a thickness of 130 feet in some places. It was once a series of nummulitic limestone reefs permeated with skeletons of Radiolaria. The whole of the carbonate of lime has disappeared, even from this non-igneous rock, and the nummulite shells have become silicified.

If the igneous rocks are changed nummulitic reefs peppered with siliceous plankton organisms, it may be asked how is the presence of magnesium, aluminium, gold, iron, radium, _etc._, to be accounted for.

It is no more difficult to explain the existence of magnesium in igneous rocks, Eozoon, _etc._, than in dolomitic limestones. In reply to my enquiry, Sir John Murray kindly informed me that the percentage of magnesium in the older parts of huge living Tridacna-shells was greater than in the younger parts. Here, at any rate, the dolomitization must have been due to the magnesium salts in the sea. The aluminium in igneous rocks is not so easily accounted for. Either it must have diffused out from a really azoic zone composed of salts of the metals, or, like magnesium, it must have come from the sea. There seems to be no other reasonable alternative. In my opinion the sea was the source. Some salts of aluminium, the sulphate for example, are so soluble that it is difficult to get crystals of them. When the ocean became precipitated on to the scarcely cooled crust of the planet, it must have taken up vast quantities of various salts. The present scarcity or total lack of aluminium* in sea water may simply be due to the fact of the salts of the metal having been used up to form the feldspars, mica, _etc._, now found in the metamorphosed paleonummulitic or igneous rocks.

Fundamentally there is but little difference between chalk and granite. Both are formed of layer upon layer of nummulitic reefs, including an admixture of plankton* organisms, _viz._, Radiolaria, coccoliths, rhabdoliths, and diatoms. In the upper chalk the silex, which is usually in bands, is derived mainly from sponge spicules (see papers by Sollas, Hinde and Zittel). The flint is usually in well-marked layers because the sponges grew on the fairly level surfaces of reefs. In the case of granite the silex is derived mainly from skeletons of unicellular organisms which rained down continually. Chalk has not been subject to igneous action, consequently the silex has diffused out unchanged, only exceptionally becoming a silicate, as in the slender glauconite core found in potstones or paramoudras. In granite, on the other hand, heat caused the silex to become a silicate and, perhaps, hastened the solution and removal of the lime.

In some very interesting examples of "Eozoon" and "salit-skarn" from Finland, very kindly sent to me by Professor Otto Trüstedt* I can see zones rich in Radiolaria alternating with calcareous zones not so rich. In comparison with Canadian examples, the Finnish specimens are only half-baked.

A so-called specimen of "Eozoon" is nothing but a piece of altered nummulitic limestone reef permeated with skeletons of Radiolaria and Diatoms. In some examples the silica united with magnesium salts and iron to form olivine. In others the silicated bands are formed of loganite (hydrous silicate of iron, magnesia and alumina). It is interesting to find silicate of alumina forming in a non-igneous rock, thereby affording evidence that the feldspar, mica, _etc._, of igneous rocks had not taken up all the aluminium.

The size and shape of the specimen of Eozoon would depend on the extent and direction of the diffusing silica, just as in the case of a flint in the chalk. For a flint also is generally nothing else than a mass of silicified nummulite shells, these being easily seen on rough weathered surfaces from which apparently transparent colloidal silica has disappeared.

## Appendix

Note 1. I take this opportunity of publishing a list of corrigenda to "The Nummulosphere," Part 1. The book was, as I pointed out, of the nature of pioneer work in a vast new territory. The statements are correct so far as the main issues are concerned.

Page 6, line 11 from bottom. The supposed branching pseudopodial canals in "Eozoon" are purely mineral structures of the nature of infiltration- or diffusion-veinings, coursing over and through nummulite shells. There are no canals in Eozoon and never have been. A specimen of Eozoon is a mass of very small nummulite shells mixed with plankton organisms, and mineralized in a peculiar way.

Page 23, line 5 from bottom. The Tudor specimen of _Eozoon_ had silicated zones as well as calcareous, but the latter were calcareous throughout and devoid of silicated casts of "canals."

Page 29, line 6 from bottom. Pico Baixo is probably no more than 500 feet high. My original estimate of 900 feet was made from a boat a mile out at sea. Recently I have been on the summit of the little pico.

Page 43, line 20 from bottom. The presence of iron compounds in the minute chambers of the nummulite shells of certain limestones and igneous rocks is probably wholly due to infiltration.

Page 43, line 15 from bottom. For a body ejected from a volcano to be able to escape from the earth altogether, it is necessary that that body should have an initial velocity of at least six miles a second. The bombs of Krakatoa are said to have had an initial velocity of only one mile a second. If this is true, it is impossible that meteorites could have been ejected on the occasion of the great eruption.

In Part 3. of "The Nummulosphere" I hope to bring forward biological evidence tending to confirm Sir Robert Ball's theory that meteorites were ejected from _ancient_ terrestrial volcanoes.

Page 45, lines 6-12 from top. _Re_ a specimen showing granite intruded into gneiss. I refer to the gneiss as "probably sedimentary." I do not think it was, for I find both benthos and plankton in certain gneisses, and it is doubtful whether these elements would remain in evidence to the same extent in sedimentary rocks.

Page 55, lines 4-8 from top. It is unlikely that the Agua do Porto Santo owes its alkalinity to salts that had once formed part of an acid trachyte, for there is an excess of soda in the latter.

Page 55, line 5 from top. For "de" read "do."

Page 64, lines 10 and 21 from top. Typical Jurassic oolitic strata contain, in addition to oolitic grains, nummulitic _débris_ derived from the wearing down of hard chalk-like Stromatoporoid reefs. In the quarries of Portland (Dorset), the "Curf," between the typically oolitic "whit" and "base" beds, and the cherty limestone beds below the "base" appear to be reefs of this kind, which have grown _in situ_, but apparently the typical oolite formations are sedimentary.

Flint and chert are mainly silicified Stromatoporoid structures, a fact which can easily be verified by examining the rough weathered surfaces of many flints. The silica has been derived from Sponges, Radiolaria and Diatoms.

Page 72, footnote, lines 5 to 1 from bottom. The pure crystalline quartz rock referred to contains numerous and indubitable traces of Radiolaria and diatoms. The benthos nummulitic element is difficult to detect. This ultra-acid rock may be compared to a parboiled Barbados Earth in which plankton elements are intermixed with silicified nummulites.

Page 88, line 14 from top. Since the Transvaal diamond rock is an altered marine formation, possibly the carbon of diamonds may have been derived from that which was fixed in the cell-walls of algae. It is, I believe, held by many that much or all of the pure carbon found in nature has probably had an organic origin.

Note 2. The cover design drawn by Mr. Highley represents benthos and plankton, the former being magnified about 10 diameters and the latter from about 500 to 2,000 diameters. The plankton organisms after a brief existence in sunlit waters sink in funereal procession to the depths.

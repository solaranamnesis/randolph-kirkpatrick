## Introduction

The discovery of the original organic nature of the igneous rocks was led up to by finding that _Eozoon_ was a Stromatoporoid,* _i.e._ a colonial nummulite. Accordingly it is essential to give a brief preliminary account of _Eozoön canadense_ (see Chapter 1.).

*) Στρῶμα layer, πὁρος pore, Stromatoporoids being formed of organically connected _layers_ of nummulites, each shell having a _central perforation_, the umbilicus. The name was given to certain Palaeozoic fossils having a "layered" structure and peculiar pores on the surface. Many theories have been put forward to explain the nature of these layers and pores.

The mere mention of the name of the Dawn Animal seems not infrequently to excite violent igneous action, a phenomenon which should not be evoked unnecessarily. With a sense of the responsibility incurred, I do not hesitate to declare that now there is convincing evidence as to the real nature of that organism around which so much controversy has raged. The modern scientific world is almost unanimous in its belief that _Eozoön_* is of purely mineral origin. In a memoir on the "Azoic System," two writers refer* to the "extraordinary delusion which has prevailed among palaeontologists with reference to the organic nature of _Eozoön_." Such delusions, in the case of those possessed by them, are charitably assumed to be supplemented by the desire to do something sensational. The _coup de grâce_ is supposed to be given to the organic theory because certain writers seem to have carried their conclusions to absurd lengths. Dr. Otto Hahn, who wrote about the organisms found in meteorites and on the vegetable nature of _Eozoön_, comes in for special mention. But, as Herbert Spencer observed ('First Principles,' _ed._ 1884, p. 568), when he was being baited by hostile critics, there is an essential difference "between intrinsic absurdity and extrinsic absurdity."*

*) _Eozoön_ is a word of four syllables.

*) _Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool._ Harvard, 1884, 7. p. 534. J. D. Whitney and M. E. Wadsworth. "The Azoic System."

*) I have found Dr. Hahn's writings very interesting. He was nearer the truth than were his critics. He regarded _Eozoön_, granite, meteorites, _etc._, as mainly composed of plants. The branching canals of _Eozoön_ are consigned to several genera of algae. Dr. Hahn did not allow for the changes produced by mineralisation. The oogonia of "Chilocarpon" shown on Pl. 10. of "Die Urzelle" are probably young nummulite buds, the supposed cell-nuclei being pores or septal apertures. The umbilicus is shown in each bud.

Then, again, these writers accuse zoologists and palaeontologists of entire ignorance as to the great variety of forms occurring in the mineral kingdom, forms "which it only requires an imaginative temperament to endow with the attributes of organic structure." That may be so, but I sometimes find in petrologists a lack of knowledge of the variety of forms of organic life, and a tendency to mistake organic structures, - as, for example, the branching pseudopodial canals of _Eozoön_ - for purely mineral formations. They are so engrossed in the difficult study of the mineralogical characters of rocks that they seem unwilling to regard these objects from other points of view. It almost irritates them to see a zoologist prying about with a magnifying glass, apparently with nefarious designs on their property. They resent the suggestion that about half their territory should be annexed by palaeontology, and naturally they are impatient when they see some palaeontologist trespassing in their galleries and asking to look at the volcanic rocks representing the types of _Eozoön atlanticum, pacificum, etc._*

*) In presenting to the British Museum the collection of rocks I made at Madeira and Porto Santo Island, I shall be confronted with a dilemma more perplexing than one which Solomon had to face on a certain occasion. When he was called upon to settle a dispute between two women as to the ownership of a babe he had a simple problem to deal with, for the child actually belonged to one of the claimants. I am in doubt, however, how to settle the rival claims of the mineralogical and palaeontological departments. For the specimens are examples of _Eozoön_ (or _Stromatopora_) _atlanticum_ in the form of lava, basalt, trachyte, granitoid rock, _etc._ Perhaps the best solution will be to cut the collection into two halves.

Evidently, what the above quoted authors did not see is not to be allowed to exist, and anyone who dares assert that he finds evidence of the former existence of organic structure in igneous rocks will incur Athanasian penalties, and his book will be entered on the said authors' "Index" of "gems."

I believe that many conclusions of these writers are based on _a priori_ conceptions. They write (_l.c._ p. 526) "rocks must necessarily be azoic, when formed or originating under such conditions as were incompatible with life." Certainly this conclusion must be accepted. Then they go on to say, "The original crust of the earth must have been azoic, if we adopt the views held by the large majority of geologists that our globe has cooled down from a former condition of igneous fluidity. The volcanic and eruptive rocks must necessarily be azoic because they have come from the heated interior of the globe, reaching the surface in a melted condition. We do not, however, designate the eruptive and volcanic rocks as 'Azoic'; the fact that they are necessarily in this condition is assumed as something self-evident." On the contrary the original _organic_ nature of these rocks is to me self-evident, because I can see the Foraminiferal structure in them, and often very clearly indeed. There is no need, I believe, to bring the nature of the earth's interior into the question. The igneous rocks are mainly masses of crystallised silicates. Numerous fossils of later age, with skeletons originally consisting of pure calcium carbonate become masses of silica. The earliest formed Foraminiferal rocks often became changed into silica compounds. After this change had taken place, there came periods of disturbance of the earth's crust, owing to the cooling and contraction of the warm sphere in its medium of cold space. The compression and re-adjustment of the crust caused a rise in temperature sufficient to reduce to a more or less molten state the silicated limestones, but in spite of this the intractable Foraminiferal medals often retain to a considerable extent their arrangement and pattern, as can be seen by careful and patient observation.

The supposed Azoic crust of the earth is Eozoic down to its known foundations and is, as Dana stated, "the only universal formation." The known part of the earth's "rind" is only a pellicle a few miles thick, and what is that in comparison with the diameter of the globe?

The above remarks are not written in an aggressive spirit. I believe 'The Azoic System'* to be a splendid piece of work reflecting great credit on the authors, but I am now in a position to say with certainty that they are mistaken in their opinion that _Eozoön canadense_ is of purely mineral origin. They and the scientific world in general are not to be blamed for their error, for correct ideas concerning the structure of _Eozoön_ have only recently been arrived at. I find that I myself, in spite of having had exceptional opportunities for learning the truth, have misinterpreted the character and orientation of the coiled disks of which this colonial Foraminiferan is built up, and one of the objects of this paper is to correct the mistake.

*) According to my observations there is no "Azoic" System. I hope that in place of "breathing out threatenings and slaughter" against heretical "Eozoists," believers in the Azoic doctrine will now become apostles of the organic theory. The term "Eozoic" is to be preferred to "Archaean," introduced by Dana.

Since the personal factor has to be taken into consideration I would mention that for many years I have been in charge of one of the most important collections of Foraminifera in existence. Further, I have observed igneous phenomena of the volcanic kind in action in various parts of the world, _viz._, Italy, Sicily, Lipari Islands, Java and Teneriffe, and know something of their effects. I once spent nearly three days and a night on the summit of Stromboli, and there learned how various were the phenomena comprised under the term "igneous action."

It has taken over eighty years to settle the problem of the nature of Stromatoporoids. Almost by accident, I discovered the clue to the labyrinth, by noting the systems of Foraminiferal chambers coiled each round its respective umbilicus, and found that these myterious fossils were colonial Foraminifera built up of nummulitic shells. I little realised at the time the developments that would follow, and that the clue to the nature of _Eozoön_ and of the igneous rocks had been found. Again, it has taken fifty years to settle the _Eozoön_ problem, simply because an important link in the chain of evidence, _viz._, that of the coiled Foraminiferal shell, was missing. There is no need, then, to suspect that the theory here expounded is like Jonah's gourd. It will be found that the Stromatoporoid theory is based on very solid foundations.

If the statements here put forward concerning the origin of igneous rocks are doubted, I can only repeat what Desmarest used to say to importunate Neptunians, "Go and see."* If again it should be thought that the nummulitic disk is a phantom, I ask how does it come about that I am able by its means to solve, as I believe, important problems in palaeontology. For the disks have furnished the clue to the mystery* of the Dolomitic and Oolitic Limestones. It was a specimen of _Eozoön canadense_ that led me on to the solution of the problem of the Jurassic Oolites.

*) Quoted in Lyell's 'Principles of Geology,' ed. 12., vol. 1. p. 72.

*) The word "mystery" is used, because many of the limestones formed during the successive eras have been regarded hiterto simply as limestones.

As as result of many thousands of observations I have found that the plutonic rocks are metamorphosed nummulitic limestones silicated,* reduced to a more or less molten condition, and crystallized, and that volcanic rocks have had an identical origin with the plutonic. Certain Ordovician, Liassic, Permian and Jurassic limestones are also nummulitic, the Dolomitic being dolomitised, and Oolitic scarcely altered chemically.

*) A term used in a general sense to include change into silicates of various kinds, _viz._ of alumina, magnesium, with soda, potash, silica, iron, _etc._ "Silicified" implies conversion into silica.

Several writers have described traces of organic structure in igneous rocks, but they have failed to convince anyone as to the soundness of their observations, but the fact of the nummulitic nature of these rocks will soon, I believe, be generally admitted, and fortunately it is possible for anyone to look into the matter himself, the only equipment necessary being patient observation and a good lens magnifying 10 diameters.

The disks may be seen separate, or overlapping obliquely in rows, or as rouleaux in vertical section. They may be closely pressed together and flattened out like rolled oats. Each disk will show _en face_ the central umbilicus, a concentric and radial pattern, and frequently rows of pores. On vertical section the very minute regular network pattern, apparently formed by the edges of alar prolongations and septa, will be visible on each side of the umbilicus. I have observed all these structures in many igneous, Jurassic oolitic and Permian dolomitic rocks. Sometimes I have found it necessary to examine a fragment of rock with the closest scrutiny for hours before convincing myself that I have seen all the above-mentioned details. In the end I have come across structures that cannot possibly have arisen from a mere chance agglomeration of particles, but which must be the expression of original organic structure. The disks are usually best seen in a good side light from above. A bright light shining directly on the piece of rock that is being examined is apt to bring into relief the particles or grains which make up the Foraminiferal medals rather than the medals themselves. Impressionist pictures, when too closely viewed in a glare of light, show unduly the blobs of paint rather than the picture. A close scrutiny of the rocks is desirable, however, in all lights, direct and oblique, bright and less bright.

As regards methods, I carefully examine pieces of rock, firstly with the naked eye, then with an aplanatic lens magnifying 10 diameters, then with a Zeiss binocular magnifying 20 to 70 diameters, and lastly in thick and thin sections with high powers.

The lens is the most ready and satisfactory. For generally one is dealing with altered, ruined, and blasted structures, which are easier seen as objects of three dimensions than in thin sections.

My views on igneous and certain other rocks have been received with a good deal of scepticism, and this is not surprising. For here, almost at our doors is a new continent, the existence of which has never been suspected. I first sighted the new land in September 1912 (when I found that the Palaeozoic Stromatoporoids were colonial Foraminifera and in that _Eozoön_ was a Stromatoporoid). What at first appeared to be an island turns out to be a continent. It is not to be wondered at that I, who say so, am looked upon as a Munchausen, or as a person subject to delusions or entoptic troubles. For my part, I do not think it will be necessary to return to the theory that the Jurassic Oolites are made of grains of coral detritus derived from phantom coral reefs, or that certain Ordovician, Carboniferous and Permian (Dolomitic) limestones and igneous and gneissic rocks are of an indefinite nature.

I hope in course of time to issue a second part to this pamphlet, giving photographs, drawings and diagrams of nummulitic disks found in various rocks.

***

The design on the cover represents Neptune on the globe of waters. On one of the prongs of his trident is a piece of volcanic rock in the shape of a nummulitic disk, and in his hand is a meteorite. These emblems signify that Neptune's domain is enlarged not only at the expense of nether Jove, but also at that of high Jove whose supposed emblem of sovereignty - the thunderbolt - really belongs to the Sea God. The glow of volcanic fires results from the hammering (compression due to planetary shrinkage) of Neptune's material on the anvil of Vulcan. That it is Neptune's material that is being worked upon, is rendered clear by the image and superscription on the little medals or nummuli coined in the Sea God's mint, and easily to be deciphered by those skilled in this branch of numismatics. Neptune's bolt is poised ready to be hurled at rash and ignorant mortals of the type of the _a priori_ would-be refuter, daring to dispute the validity of his title-deeds.

The design which has been drawn by Mr. Highley, has been partly copied from prints in the British Museum.

In the course of this investigation I have received a great deal of information and many gifts of specimens from owners of quarries and of _depôts_ of stone, pumice and mica, who have shown me much kindness, which I very gratefully acknowledge. I wish especially to express my gratitude to Senhor A. C. Noronha, who gave me the fragments of volcanic rock that started me on the present enquiry.

I regret that I have not been able to marshal all my facts in strictly logical order, this failure being due to the continual cropping up of new discoveries after I had revised the first and second proofs of my pamphlet. Some allowance will, I trust, be made on account of the difficulties attending what may fairly be termed pioneer work in an almost unexplored territory.

## 1. On _Eozoön Canadense_ Dawson.

"A false theory, it is well known, may render us blind to facts which are opposed to our prepossessions, or may conceal from us their true import when we behold them." - Lyell, 'Principles of Geology,' ed. 12., vol. 2., p. 179.

I do not intend to enter here into details concerning the history of the _Eozoön_ controversy, and shall merely refer to a few of the more important points.

The original specimens of _Eozoön_ were found by the officers of the Geological Survey of Canada in the Lower Laurentian Limestone rocks about 1850-1858. These specimens had a layered aspect at their weathered edges; and a vertical section revealed alternating white and greenish-yellow bands. The white bands were found to be calcareous (calcite or dolomite) and the green bands siliceous (loganite, olivine, serpentine, _etc._). It seemed unlikely that any traces whatsoever of organic structure could exist in rocks of unimaginable antiquity, vastly older than the Cambrian, and in rocks which had been exposed to terrific metamorphosing agencies.

## Explanation of Plates

Photographs (made from untouched negatives) of very young shells found in sections of _Eozoön canadense_. They should be examined in different lights, with and without the aid of a lens.

Figs. 1-4. - A nummulite shell, about 1/10 of a millimetre (1/250 of an inch) in diameter, focussed from above down at four different levels. x270.

A careful study of the actual shell shows at least four spiral coils wound round the funnel-shaped umbilicus. The large primary chamber is a little to the right and above the pore-like upper opening of the umbilicus. Each of the larger dark spots is probably a large pore; double rows of very minute dots in Fig. 2 are smaller pores. The obscure radial lines are fractures in the neighbourhood of septa. The large irregular light patch to the right of the centre shows a broken area. "Willow pattern" obscurely visible along broken edge in Figs. 2, 3. (See Fig. 15.)

Fig. 5. - Lower surface of above shell. In the centre is seen a defined oval area (3 by 2 millimetres) with a faintly shaded spot in the centre of the oval. The oval area is the wide lower orifice of the funnel-shaped umbilicus, and the faint spot is the minute aperture at the upper end of the same.

Fig. 6. - Another shell broken across and showing the "willow-pattern" at upper end of fractured surface. There are visible four alar prolongations on each side of the central line, apical chambers, and dark spaces and septa between the alae (see Fig. 16.).

Figs. 7-10. - Upper aspect of a still younger shell. The Nautilus-like embracing of the last coil but one by thelast coil is fairly well shown at the lower part of the figures, and also (in Fig. 7) the lopping round of the four or five last-formed septa and segments. x270.

Fig. 11. - A young shell on surface of etched out specimen. Seen by reflected light. The central dark area is the (? lower) opening of the umbilicus. x270.

Fig. 12. - Outer weathered surface of _Eozoön_ showing circular outlines of larger adult nummulite shells. x3. Fairly good examples of disks can be seen (with aid of lens) on each side of oblique dark streak near upper left corner. Compare also Fig. 23.

Fig. 13. - Under surface of shell shown in Figs. 7-10. x250.

Fig. 14. - Canals in one of the white bands of _Eozoön_, showing series of rings. x270. Compare Figs. 17-22.

Fig. 15. - A tracing of Fig. 2. _a_, Upper opening of umbilicus; _b_, edge of final alar prolongation; _c_, primary chamber; _d_, segments or chambers of final coil; _e_, larger pseudopodial pores; _f_ double row of minute pseudopodial pores; _g_, segments of last coil but one.

Fig. 16. - Enlarged drawing of upper part of broken edge of shell shown in Fig. 14. _a_, an outer alar prolongation, enclosing _b_, the next in succession; _c_, edges of septa separating the alae, these portions of septa being prolongations from the partitions separating the peripheral part of the whole into segments; _d_, spaces between the alae and in continuity with the chambers at the periphery of the whorl; _e_, chambers at periphery of the successive whorls.

The parts are emphasised, but can be seen in photo, by using a lens.

N.B. The spiral coils and willow pattern seen respectively in horizontal and vertical sections are precisely the same as are found in typical Nummulites.

Fig. 17. - Oval rings in canals of _Eozoön canadense_.

Fig. 18. - Ditto from larger canals in another specimen.

Fig. 19. - Rings and half-rings from mural tubuli of the Palaeozoic Stromatoporoid _Actinostroma clathratum_, Nicholson.

Fig. 20. - The same from _Stromatopora concentrica_, Goldfuss.

Fig. 21. - The same from a recent specimen of _Sporadotrema cylindricum_ (Carter) from the China Sea. 

Figs. 17-21 are copied by kind permission of Messrs. Taylor and Francis from a paper by the author in _Annals Mag. Nat. Hist., Sept. 1912. Reduced from a magnification of 1,300 diameters.

Fig. 22. - Canals in supplementary skeleton of _Eozoön canadense_, being part of photograph show in Fig. 14.

[Fig. 23.](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-23.webp) - Weathered surface of _Eozoön_, showing rows of disks _en face_, from an area about three-quarters of an inch (18 millimetres) square a little above and to the right of centre of lower line of figure shown in Fig. 12. The disk outlines have been somewhat emphasised to enable them to be traced in the photograph. Enlarged about 3 times from photo, _i.e._ about 10 times from nature.

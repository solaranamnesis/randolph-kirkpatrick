## Introduction

The discovery of the original organic nature of the igneous rocks was led up to by finding that _Eozoon_ was a Stromatoporoid,* _i.e._ a colonial nummulite. Accordingly it is essential to give a brief preliminary account of _Eozoön canadense_ (see Chapter 1.).

*) Στρῶμα layer, πὁρος pore, Stromatoporoids being formed of organically connected _layers_ of nummulites, each shell having a _central perforation_, the umbilicus. The name was given to certain Palaeozoic fossils having a "layered" structure and peculiar pores on the surface. Many theories have been put forward to explain the nature of these layers and pores.

The mere mention of the name of the Dawn Animal seems not infrequently to excite violent igneous action, a phenomenon which should not be evoked unnecessarily. With a sense of the responsibility incurred, I do not hesitate to declare that now there is convincing evidence as to the real nature of that organism around which so much controversy has raged. The modern scientific world is almost unanimous in its belief that _Eozoön_* is of purely mineral origin. In a memoir on the "Azoic System," two writers refer* to the "extraordinary delusion which has prevailed among palaeontologists with reference to the organic nature of _Eozoön_." Such delusions, in the case of those possessed by them, are charitably assumed to be supplemented by the desire to do something sensational. The _coup de grâce_ is supposed to be given to the organic theory because certain writers seem to have carried their conclusions to absurd lengths. Dr. Otto Hahn, who wrote about the organisms found in meteorites and on the vegetable nature of _Eozoön_, comes in for special mention. But, as Herbert Spencer observed ('First Principles,' _ed._ 1884, p. 568), when he was being baited by hostile critics, there is an essential difference "between intrinsic absurdity and extrinsic absurdity."*

*) _Eozoön_ is a word of four syllables.

*) _Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool._ Harvard, 1884, 7. p. 534. J. D. Whitney and M. E. Wadsworth. "The Azoic System."

*) I have found Dr. Hahn's writings very interesting. He was nearer the truth than were his critics. He regarded _Eozoön_, granite, meteorites, _etc._, as mainly composed of plants. The branching canals of _Eozoön_ are consigned to several genera of algae. Dr. Hahn did not allow for the changes produced by mineralisation. The oogonia of "Chilocarpon" shown on Pl. 10. of "Die Urzelle" are probably young nummulite buds, the supposed cell-nuclei being pores or septal apertures. The umbilicus is shown in each bud.

Then, again, these writers accuse zoologists and palaeontologists of entire ignorance as to the great variety of forms occurring in the mineral kingdom, forms "which it only requires an imaginative temperament to endow with the attributes of organic structure." That may be so, but I sometimes find in petrologists a lack of knowledge of the variety of forms of organic life, and a tendency to mistake organic structures, - as, for example, the branching pseudopodial canals of _Eozoön_ - for purely mineral formations. They are so engrossed in the difficult study of the mineralogical characters of rocks that they seem unwilling to regard these objects from other points of view. It almost irritates them to see a zoologist prying about with a magnifying glass, apparently with nefarious designs on their property. They resent the suggestion that about half their territory should be annexed by palaeontology, and naturally they are impatient when they see some palaeontologist trespassing in their galleries and asking to look at the volcanic rocks representing the types of _Eozoön atlanticum, pacificum, etc._*

*) In presenting to the British Museum the collection of rocks I made at Madeira and Porto Santo Island, I shall be confronted with a dilemma more perplexing than one which Solomon had to face on a certain occasion. When he was called upon to settle a dispute between two women as to the ownership of a babe he had a simple problem to deal with, for the child actually belonged to one of the claimants. I am in doubt, however, how to settle the rival claims of the mineralogical and palaeontological departments. For the specimens are examples of _Eozoön_ (or _Stromatopora_) _atlanticum_ in the form of lava, basalt, trachyte, granitoid rock, _etc._ Perhaps the best solution will be to cut the collection into two halves.

Evidently, what the above quoted authors did not see is not to be allowed to exist, and anyone who dares assert that he finds evidence of the former existence of organic structure in igneous rocks will incur Athanasian penalties, and his book will be entered on the said authors' "Index" of "gems."

I believe that many conclusions of these writers are based on _a priori_ conceptions. They write (_l.c._ p. 526) "rocks must necessarily be azoic, when formed or originating under such conditions as were incompatible with life." Certainly this conclusion must be accepted. Then they go on to say, "The original crust of the earth must have been azoic, if we adopt the views held by the large majority of geologists that our globe has cooled down from a former condition of igneous fluidity. The volcanic and eruptive rocks must necessarily be azoic because they have come from the heated interior of the globe, reaching the surface in a melted condition. We do not, however, designate the eruptive and volcanic rocks as 'Azoic'; the fact that they are necessarily in this condition is assumed as something self-evident." On the contrary the original _organic_ nature of these rocks is to me self-evident, because I can see the Foraminiferal structure in them, and often very clearly indeed. There is no need, I believe, to bring the nature of the earth's interior into the question. The igneous rocks are mainly masses of crystallised silicates. Numerous fossils of later age, with skeletons originally consisting of pure calcium carbonate become masses of silica. The earliest formed Foraminiferal rocks often became changed into silica compounds. After this change had taken place, there came periods of disturbance of the earth's crust, owing to the cooling and contraction of the warm sphere in its medium of cold space. The compression and re-adjustment of the crust caused a rise in temperature sufficient to reduce to a more or less molten state the silicated limestones, but in spite of this the intractable Foraminiferal medals often retain to a considerable extent their arrangement and pattern, as can be seen by careful and patient observation.

The supposed Azoic crust of the earth is Eozoic down to its known foundations and is, as Dana stated, "the only universal formation." The known part of the earth's "rind" is only a pellicle a few miles thick, and what is that in comparison with the diameter of the globe?

The above remarks are not written in an aggressive spirit. I believe 'The Azoic System'* to be a splendid piece of work reflecting great credit on the authors, but I am now in a position to say with certainty that they are mistaken in their opinion that _Eozoön canadense_ is of purely mineral origin. They and the scientific world in general are not to be blamed for their error, for correct ideas concerning the structure of _Eozoön_ have only recently been arrived at. I find that I myself, in spite of having had exceptional opportunities for learning the truth, have misinterpreted the character and orientation of the coiled disks of which this colonial Foraminiferan is built up, and one of the objects of this paper is to correct the mistake.

*) According to my observations there is no "Azoic" System. I hope that in place of "breathing out threatenings and slaughter" against heretical "Eozoists," believers in the Azoic doctrine will now become apostles of the organic theory. The term "Eozoic" is to be preferred to "Archaean," introduced by Dana.

Since the personal factor has to be taken into consideration I would mention that for many years I have been in charge of one of the most important collections of Foraminifera in existence. Further, I have observed igneous phenomena of the volcanic kind in action in various parts of the world, _viz._, Italy, Sicily, Lipari Islands, Java and Teneriffe, and know something of their effects. I once spent nearly three days and a night on the summit of Stromboli, and there learned how various were the phenomena comprised under the term "igneous action."

It has taken over eighty years to settle the problem of the nature of Stromatoporoids. Almost by accident, I discovered the clue to the labyrinth, by noting the systems of Foraminiferal chambers coiled each round its respective umbilicus, and found that these myterious fossils were colonial Foraminifera built up of nummulitic shells. I little realised at the time the developments that would follow, and that the clue to the nature of _Eozoön_ and of the igneous rocks had been found. Again, it has taken fifty years to settle the _Eozoön_ problem, simply because an important link in the chain of evidence, _viz._, that of the coiled Foraminiferal shell, was missing. There is no need, then, to suspect that the theory here expounded is like Jonah's gourd. It will be found that the Stromatoporoid theory is based on very solid foundations.

If the statements here put forward concerning the origin of igneous rocks are doubted, I can only repeat what Desmarest used to say to importunate Neptunians, "Go and see."* If again it should be thought that the nummulitic disk is a phantom, I ask how does it come about that I am able by its means to solve, as I believe, important problems in palaeontology. For the disks have furnished the clue to the mystery* of the Dolomitic and Oolitic Limestones. It was a specimen of _Eozoön canadense_ that led me on to the solution of the problem of the Jurassic Oolites.

*) Quoted in Lyell's 'Principles of Geology,' ed. 12., vol. 1. p. 72.

*) The word "mystery" is used, because many of the limestones formed during the successive eras have been regarded hiterto simply as limestones.

As as result of many thousands of observations I have found that the plutonic rocks are metamorphosed nummulitic limestones silicated,* reduced to a more or less molten condition, and crystallized, and that volcanic rocks have had an identical origin with the plutonic. Certain Ordovician, Liassic, Permian and Jurassic limestones are also nummulitic, the Dolomitic being dolomitised, and Oolitic scarcely altered chemically.

*) A term used in a general sense to include change into silicates of various kinds, _viz._ of alumina, magnesium, with soda, potash, silica, iron, _etc._ "Silicified" implies conversion into silica.

Several writers have described traces of organic structure in igneous rocks, but they have failed to convince anyone as to the soundness of their observations, but the fact of the nummulitic nature of these rocks will soon, I believe, be generally admitted, and fortunately it is possible for anyone to look into the matter himself, the only equipment necessary being patient observation and a good lens magnifying 10 diameters.

The disks may be seen separate, or overlapping obliquely in rows, or as rouleaux in vertical section. They may be closely pressed together and flattened out like rolled oats. Each disk will show _en face_ the central umbilicus, a concentric and radial pattern, and frequently rows of pores. On vertical section the very minute regular network pattern, apparently formed by the edges of alar prolongations and septa, will be visible on each side of the umbilicus. I have observed all these structures in many igneous, Jurassic oolitic and Permian dolomitic rocks. Sometimes I have found it necessary to examine a fragment of rock with the closest scrutiny for hours before convincing myself that I have seen all the above-mentioned details. In the end I have come across structures that cannot possibly have arisen from a mere chance agglomeration of particles, but which must be the expression of original organic structure. The disks are usually best seen in a good side light from above. A bright light shining directly on the piece of rock that is being examined is apt to bring into relief the particles or grains which make up the Foraminiferal medals rather than the medals themselves. Impressionist pictures, when too closely viewed in a glare of light, show unduly the blobs of paint rather than the picture. A close scrutiny of the rocks is desirable, however, in all lights, direct and oblique, bright and less bright.

As regards methods, I carefully examine pieces of rock, firstly with the naked eye, then with an aplanatic lens magnifying 10 diameters, then with a Zeiss binocular magnifying 20 to 70 diameters, and lastly in thick and thin sections with high powers.

The lens is the most ready and satisfactory. For generally one is dealing with altered, ruined, and blasted structures, which are easier seen as objects of three dimensions than in thin sections.

My views on igneous and certain other rocks have been received with a good deal of scepticism, and this is not surprising. For here, almost at our doors is a new continent, the existence of which has never been suspected. I first sighted the new land in September 1912 (when I found that the Palaeozoic Stromatoporoids were colonial Foraminifera and in that _Eozoön_ was a Stromatoporoid). What at first appeared to be an island turns out to be a continent. It is not to be wondered at that I, who say so, am looked upon as a Munchausen, or as a person subject to delusions or entoptic troubles. For my part, I do not think it will be necessary to return to the theory that the Jurassic Oolites are made of grains of coral detritus derived from phantom coral reefs, or that certain Ordovician, Carboniferous and Permian (Dolomitic) limestones and igneous and gneissic rocks are of an indefinite nature.

I hope in course of time to issue a second part to this pamphlet, giving photographs, drawings and diagrams of nummulitic disks found in various rocks.

***

The design on the cover represents Neptune on the globe of waters. On one of the prongs of his trident is a piece of volcanic rock in the shape of a nummulitic disk, and in his hand is a meteorite. These emblems signify that Neptune's domain is enlarged not only at the expense of nether Jove, but also at that of high Jove whose supposed emblem of sovereignty - the thunderbolt - really belongs to the Sea God. The glow of volcanic fires results from the hammering (compression due to planetary shrinkage) of Neptune's material on the anvil of Vulcan. That it is Neptune's material that is being worked upon, is rendered clear by the image and superscription on the little medals or nummuli coined in the Sea God's mint, and easily to be deciphered by those skilled in this branch of numismatics. Neptune's bolt is poised ready to be hurled at rash and ignorant mortals of the type of the _a priori_ would-be refuter, daring to dispute the validity of his title-deeds.

The design which has been drawn by Mr. Highley, has been partly copied from prints in the British Museum.

In the course of this investigation I have received a great deal of information and many gifts of specimens from owners of quarries and of _depôts_ of stone, pumice and mica, who have shown me much kindness, which I very gratefully acknowledge. I wish especially to express my gratitude to Senhor A. C. Noronha, who gave me the fragments of volcanic rock that started me on the present enquiry.

I regret that I have not been able to marshal all my facts in strictly logical order, this failure being due to the continual cropping up of new discoveries after I had revised the first and second proofs of my pamphlet. Some allowance will, I trust, be made on account of the difficulties attending what may fairly be termed pioneer work in an almost unexplored territory.

## 1. On _Eozoön Canadense_ Dawson.

"A false theory, it is well known, may render us blind to facts which are opposed to our prepossessions, or may conceal from us their true import when we behold them." - Lyell, 'Principles of Geology,' ed. 12., vol. 2., p. 179.

I do not intend to enter here into details concerning the history of the _Eozoön_ controversy, and shall merely refer to a few of the more important points.

The original specimens of _Eozoön_ were found by the officers of the Geological Survey of Canada in the Lower Laurentian Limestone rocks about 1850-1858. These specimens had a layered aspect at their weathered edges; and a vertical section revealed alternating white and greenish-yellow bands. The white bands were found to be calcareous (calcite or dolomite) and the green bands siliceous (loganite, olivine, serpentine, _etc._). It seemed unlikely that any traces whatsoever of organic structure could exist in rocks of unimaginable antiquity, vastly older than the Cambrian, and in rocks which had been exposed to terrific metamorphosing agencies. As Sir W. Dawson observed, some of the gneisses between which the limestones were imbedded had been squeezed and twisted as if they had been put through a mangle. At the same time he and Sir W. Logan were struck with the resemblance between these layered and banded lumps of rock and the Palaeozoic Stromatoporoids. Accordingly Dawson concluded they were really fossils and gave them the name _Eozoön canadense_. Specimens were brought to London, and investigated by Dr. W. B. Carpenter, who endorsed the verdict of Dawson.

Carpenter regarded the greenish bands as chambers of a Foraminiferan, and the white bands as secondary skeleton. He described canals ramifying in the white bands and showed their similarity to the canals of the secondary skeleton of recent Foraminifera.

Specimens were now referred to Prof. Carl Möbius of Kiel, who had published several memoirs on Foraminifera.

He wrote a splendid monograph* on _Eozoön_ illustrated by eighteen beautiful plates, and his verdict was against the theory of organic origin. I was much struck with the fact that among the forty-seven figures illustrating the structure of _Eozoön_, I could only find one (Pl. 34. Fig. 44) which showed something that might possibly be regarded as evidence of organic structure. It is not to be wondered at that the distinguished Professor of Kiel was unable to accept the "organic" theory. If he had seen certain rings and coils in the branching canals, probably he would have hesitated before giving his verdict in favour of the mineral theory, and if he had seen under the microscope the young Foraminiferal shells shown in the Plate at the end of this pamphlet, he would most certainly have given the whole weight of his influence in support of the theory of organic origin.

*) 'Palaeontographica,' vol. 25., 1878, p. 175.

Professors Rowney and King of Galway likewise proceeded to demolish the theory of organic origin, and ransacked the mineral kingdom for minerals which appeared to show all the varieties of structure which Carpenter had found in _Eozoön_ and which he had brought forward as proofs of organic origin.

Later, Professors J. W. Gregory and Johnston-Lavis published a memoir on the Monte Somma bombs, which had a structure almost identical with that of _Eozoön_. Here apparently was the _coup de grâce_ to the organic theory. Was anyone going to be so insane as to assert that fossils retaining any trace of organic structure could be hurled up as bombs from a volcano?

In the _Annals_, October 1912, I stated that these bombs actually were examples of _Eozoön_, and so they undoubtedly are. I was mistaken in assuming that the broken down siliceous bands were composed of serpentine. At that time I had not read the authors' fine memoir on the Eozoonal structure of the ejected blocks of Monte Somma.*

*) The authors point out (_Trans. Roy. Dublin Soc._, 5., 1894, p. 266) that as regards the alternating silicate and calcite laminae the bombs completely resemble _Eozoön_. The silicate laminae are composed typically of peridote and spinel, and do not undergo serpentinisation. In the _Annals Mag._, October, 1912, p. 452, I recorded the finding of _Melobesia_ and of obscure traces of Polyzoa in a Monte Somma bomb. I have now confirmed this discovery. Two botanists to whom I showed a mounted fragment of the supposed alga, thought it resembled vegetable tissue. I have found traces of more than one species of Polyzoa. I remarked that the presence of these organisms seemed to point to the conclusion that Monte Somma had been under the sea, but it is not certain where the bomb came from. Professors Johnston-Lavis and Gregory state that most of the bombs are found among deposits of pumice forming a mantle round Monte Somma, especially amidst the material ejected during Phase 6 and Phase 7 (Plinian eruption A.D. 79). The bomb encrusted with organisms belongs to the Hamilton Collection in the Natural History Museum. Of course, it may have been picked up at some distance from Monte Somma, but I think not, because the encrusting organisms show traces of fusion, and must have been among hot scoriae, _etc._ So it is possible that before the historic period Monte Somma may have been submerged. If so, it would not be a very exceptional cirumstance. The columns of the Temple of Serapis, a few miles to the west, have been rising and falling frequently like a pressure gauge. When Vesuvius is quiet they rise, and after periods of activity they sink (Lyell, 'Principles,' ed. 12., 2., p. 171). The south-west base of Vesuvius from Portici to Torre del Annunziata is by the margin of the sea.

Scientific men were now satisfied that _Eozoön_ was an object of purely mineral origin, and were probably thankful to have the matter settled. In none of the standard works (Zittel, Steinmann, Hartog, Lister, Geikie, Bütschli), is _Eozoön_ accepted as an organism.

Sir Archibald Geikie ('Text-Book of Geology,' ed. 4., 1903, p. 879) maintained a position of judicious reserve amidst the clash of opposing views. Möbius had stated that the canals and passages were infiltration veinings of serpentine in calcite. Geikie pointed out, however, that sometimes the canal-systems are filled in with dolomite, and therefore must have been hollow before either serpentine or dolomite were introduced; and, further, he observed that no structure precisely similar to that of some specimens of _Eozoön_ had been discovered. On the other hand, he demanded that evidence brought forward in support of the organic theory should be clear and indubitable.

In the course of an investigation of the _Monticuliporoids_, I was led to examine the group of Palaeozoic fossils known as Stromatoporoids (layered pore animals). I found in them certain rings with signet-like swellings shaped somewhat like the siliceous rings of the siliceous sponge, _Merlia normani_, and I concluded that Stromatoporoids were sponges. But presently I found similar bodies in recent Foraminifera, and soon saw many reasons for believing that these fossils belonged to that group. On examining Dr. Carpenter's sections of _Eozoön_, I was amazed to find the rings there also.

I published a paper on _Eozoön_ and _Stromatoporoids_ in the _Annals and Mag. Nat. Hist._, September 1912, stating that they were Foraminifera. I found in all of them a complicated arrangement of chambers with calcareous walls perforated by tubuli and canals, and also rings and hoops similar to those of the modern Foraminifera. At this stage I held the same views of _Eozoön_ as Carpenter, who regarded the olivine bands as models of Foraminiferal chambers.

In October 1912 I published in the same journal a paper containing several errors,* but also a very important* truth. I found that Stromatoporoids and _Eozoön_ were composed of layers of Foraminiferal shells organically united so as to form colonies. I thought at first that the shells of Stromatoporoids were Rotalian in character, and sometimes of large size with great coils of segments, but I have since found that the shells resemble those of _Eozoön_ in being typical nummulites with alar prolongations,* and in being on an average less than 5 millimetres (1/5 of an inch) in diameter. The large spiral and cyclical patterns seen on the polished slabs of some species of Stromatoporoids do not belong to single large shells, but to series of small ones. Similary the long parallel bands are vertical or oblique sections of rouleaux of shells. A x10 lens will show the disks all over the surface of _Stromatopora_, _Actinostroma_, _Beatricea_, _Labechia_, _etc._ The tubercles in specimens of the last-named genus are simply the effect of metamorphosing agencies, and I do not think the genus will stand. The Caunopora tubes belong to foreign organisms such as worms and corals.

*) When first examining the surface of a large specimen of _Eozoön canadense_, I saw branching tuft-like structures and spreading crusts, which appeared to me to be coralline algae, and to which I gave provisional names. I have found since that these supposed algae are - possibily with one exception - purely mineral structures. Certain opaque white incrustations with rounded edges, and apparently with a cellular structure may, however, be Melobesia-like algae.  
Hitherto I have only had half a dozen cleaned specimens of _Eozoön_ to work with. I have asked a colleague in Ottawa to superintend the despatch to London of a quarter of a ton of Lower Laurentian Limestone, and some graphite and gneiss in the rough, and am hopeful of finding remains of Eozoic flora, if they exist.  
In the _Annals_, October, 1912, I figured a network of pseudopods, but I find this appearance to be due to a breaking down of Eozoon-structure in olivine. Again, the growth of _Eozoön_ might be compared to a nearly sessile mushroom, but not to a fountain. Lastly, there is no evidence that the _Rotaliidae_ are derived from Stromatoporoids.

*) I think this adjective correctly describes the first of a series of observations that culminated in the discovery of the "nummulosphere" on which, strange to relate, we have been living all this time _sans le savoir_.

*) A term designating the centripetal V-shaped prolongations of a coil embracing the previously formed coils.

On the surface of specimens of _Eozoön_, if not too much crystallized, it is easy to find plenty of disks with umbilicus and radial rows of pores. Where the surface of a shell has been damaged the alae and septa can be detected.

The arrangement of disks in _Stromatopora_ and _Eozoön_ might be compared ideally with a number of vertical piles of coins, each coin having a central hole (astrorhiza or umbilicus). A Stromatoporoid approaching this ideal arrangement is found in _Receptaculites_ with its well-marked columns and fairly regular surface pattern.

A vertical section of _Eozoön_ frequently shows alternating wavy white and green bands, and curious branching canals in the white parts.

Carpenter was under the impression that a specimen of _Eozoön_ was a monster Foraminiferal shell with huge chambers arranged in layers separated by thick white bands of secondary skeleton permeated by branching canal-systems. He compared the enormously large "chambers" to those of _Polytrema_, and described them as having "grown wild," meaning thereby that they had escaped control of some spiral pattern and had become "acervuline." He regarded _Eozoön_ as a member of the _Nummulitidae_ because he thought it possessed those types of structure, _viz._ secondary skeleton and canal-system that are developed to a corresponding degree only in the higher members of that family. Brady evidently influenced by Carpenter, placed _Eozoön_ in a new sub-family of the _Nummulitidae_, _viz._, "sub-family 5 (?) _Eozoöninae_ - test forming irregular, adherent acervuline masses." "_Eozoön_ Dawson - test adherent, outlines irregular; composed of segments arranged at first in more or less regular superimposed layers, subsequently acervuline; with interseptal skeleton and ramifying canals."

It happens to be true that _Eozoön_ belongs to the _Nummulitidae_, but neither Carpenter nor Brady bring forward any evidence in support of this theory. For certainly the green spaces are not Foraminiferal chambers in any sense, the white bands are not secondary skeleton, and the dendritic structures are not pseudopodial canals.

No wonder the theory of organic origin has not been accepted by the scientific world! I can now clearly understand why Möbius and the mineralogists summarily rejected the theory of the organic origin of _Eozoön_. For it is easily conceivable that a mass of carbonate of lime of wholly inorganic origin like, for instance, a "fur" deposited from heated water might become dolomitised and silicated in zones, and the dolomite (or calcite) zones might become penetrated by branched veinings of silicates. Then the opponents of the organic theory might well point out the improbability of the survival of any trace of organic structure in very ancient rocks which had been subjected to terrific metamorphosing agencies. Again, when Eozoonal rocks were hurled up from the crater of a volcano, there was surely no need for further discussion. One might as well argue with an "earth-flattist" as with a person who stated that _Eozoön_ had once been a living organism. The history of this controversy, however, presents only one more instance of the danger of _a priori_ reasoning, for simple observation with a hand-lens shows beyond the least shadow of doubt that not only _Eozoön_ but the volcanic and plutonic rocks are mineralized organic structures.

A specimen of _Eozoön_ was once a mass of delicate hollow shells of carbonate of lime. The white and green bands in metamorphosed specimens are simply the result of a particular mode of mineralization* of this uniform mass. The convincing proof is that the nummulite shells are present both in the white and in the green bands. Even where the banded structure is well marked, the white and green layers vary greatly in thickness, and often there are large non-banded areas of white or green, and sometimes of mottled green and white. Often, too, the individual shells are composed partly of olivine and partly of dolomite. Doubtless the wholly calcareous Tudor specimen of _Eozoön_ is simply a mass of calcareous shells. A glance with a lens would settle the point. In banded trachytes there are shells in the white felspar layers and also in the earthy-brown layers, and sometimes one can see several very fine dark bands traversing one shell. In some granites, too, I often see quartz felspar andmica in a single shell. The green bands are not Foraminiferal chambers, but silicated areas each containing several nummulite shells or portions of shells, just as the dolomitised areas may each contain several shells or parts of shells.

*) It was only after this pamphlet was in the press that I realized that "mineralize" and "crystallize," _etc._, are spelled with a "z," and "dike" with an "i" in Murray, our final authority.

In 1878 Nicholson and Etheridge found certain curious labyrinthine masses of vermiculate tubes in microscopic sections of Girvan limestone. They regarded them as organisms allied to the arenaceous Foraminifera, and gave them the name _Girvanella problematica_. These objects have since been found in other limestones, especially in the Jurassic Oolites. I have found that the Girvan limestones and Oolites are nummulitic rocks, and that the Girvanella structures are simply the results of partial solution and redeposition in the hollow calcareous nummulite shells with their coil-within-coil structure. Although the chambers of any particular coil extend from the periphery to the centre, it is only the peripheral part just within the apex of the V that occupies much space, the rest of the chamber-space being the thin film between the alae or arms of the V and the outer surface of the next coil embraced by those arms. Consequently there is a tendency to the formation of series of concentric tubes. Further, the series of radiating septa of all the coils lie to a considerable extent along similar vertical radial planes, a fact rendered obvious when one views a horizontal section of a nummulite through the median plane. Consequently when a shell is subject to pressure there is a tendency for there radial septa to cut out, so to speak, a radial pattern. Again, horizontal, vertical and oblique sections through rouleaux of shells would show a complicated plexus of tubes. It is not difficult to realize that when subjected to dissolving agencies single shells or groups of shells may form little isolated granules, or big pisolitic masses. One thing is certain, _viz._ that the Girvan limestone of Tramitchel is a mass of nummulites, and that these shells undergo change from the effects of rain water and carbonic acid. Further, it is possible to trace nummulitic structures in masses of Girvanella. I believe Girvanella structure will be found in nummulitic rocks from granite to the Upper Chalk and possibly later.

I now find this structure abundantly in the dolomitised silicated masses of nummulitic limestone known as _Eozoön_. The supposed branching canals in the supposed secondary skeleton of _Eozoön_ are simply "Grivanella" structures. They exist also in the green silicated parts of specimens. Gradations can be traced from circular nummulite shells with radiating "tubes," through closely pressed fan-shaped masses, to widely branched spread-out canal systems. It is simply a matter of breaking down of shells, of masses of tubes, and of joining up into hollow canal systems like the heading-off of river systems. Naturally the silication has been effected more readily in those parts of the dolomite bands where hollow channels have formed as the result of the peculiar mode of disintegration that takes place in the nummulite shells. The peculiar "rings" seen in the canals are there because they have been present in the original shells. I do not think they are purely the product of mineralization becuase similar structures exist in recent Foraminifera. The rings and half-rings visible in decalcified preparations of spirit specimens of _Polytrema_ appear to be horny thickenings in the neighbourhood of the rims of pseudopodial pores. If this be so, a series might form along vertical rows of pores in nummulites, in which there are numerous successive layers of shell-wall especially at the central parts of the shell. The existence of these bodies in _Eozoön_ and the later Stromatoporoids may be due to mineralization of the rings, or again, the rings may have been calcareous skeletal thickenings of pore-rims. Whatever be their nature and origin, it was the finding of them in _Eozoön_ that first led me to doubt, possibly on a wrong premiss, the theory of mineral origin of that structure.

## Explanation of Plates

Photographs (made from untouched negatives) of very young shells found in sections of _Eozoön canadense_. They should be examined in different lights, with and without the aid of a lens.

[Fig. 1,](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-1.webp) [Fig. 2,](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-2.webp) [Fig. 3,](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-3.webp) [Fig. 4.](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-4.webp) - A nummulite shell, about 1/10 of a millimetre (1/250 of an inch) in diameter, focussed from above down at four different levels. x270.

A careful study of the actual shell shows at least four spiral coils wound round the funnel-shaped umbilicus. The large primary chamber is a little to the right and above the pore-like upper opening of the umbilicus. Each of the larger dark spots is probably a large pore; double rows of very minute dots in Fig. 2 are smaller pores. The obscure radial lines are fractures in the neighbourhood of septa. The large irregular light patch to the right of the centre shows a broken area. "Willow pattern" obscurely visible along broken edge in Figs. 2, 3. (See Fig. 15.)

[Fig. 5.](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-5.webp) - Lower surface of above shell. In the centre is seen a defined oval area (3 by 2 millimetres) with a faintly shaded spot in the centre of the oval. The oval area is the wide lower orifice of the funnel-shaped umbilicus, and the faint spot is the minute aperture at the upper end of the same.

[Fig. 6.](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-6.webp) - Another shell broken across and showing the "willow-pattern" at upper end of fractured surface. There are visible four alar prolongations on each side of the central line, apical chambers, and dark spaces and septa between the alae (see Fig. 16.).

[Fig. 7,](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-7.webp) [Fig. 8,](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-8.webp) [Fig. 9](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-9.webp) [Fig. 10.](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-10.webp) - Upper aspect of a still younger shell. The Nautilus-like embracing of the last coil but one by thelast coil is fairly well shown at the lower part of the figures, and also (in Fig. 7) the lopping round of the four or five last-formed septa and segments. x270.

[Fig. 11.](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-11.webp) - A young shell on surface of etched out specimen. Seen by reflected light. The central dark area is the (? lower) opening of the umbilicus. x270.

[Fig. 12.](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-12.webp) - Outer weathered surface of _Eozoön_ showing circular outlines of larger adult nummulite shells. x3. Fairly good examples of disks can be seen (with aid of lens) on each side of oblique dark streak near upper left corner. Compare also Fig. 23.

[Fig. 13.](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-13.webp) - Under surface of shell shown in Figs. 7-10. x250.

[Fig. 14.](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-14.webp) - Canals in one of the white bands of _Eozoön_, showing series of rings. x270. Compare Figs. 17-22.

[Fig. 15.](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-15.webp) - A tracing of Fig. 2. _a_, Upper opening of umbilicus; _b_, edge of final alar prolongation; _c_, primary chamber; _d_, segments or chambers of final coil; _e_, larger pseudopodial pores; _f_ double row of minute pseudopodial pores; _g_, segments of last coil but one.

[Fig. 16.](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part1/Fig-16.webp) - Enlarged drawing of upper part of broken edge of shell shown in Fig. 14. _a_, an outer alar prolongation, enclosing _b_, the next in succession; _c_, edges of septa separating the alae, these portions of septa being prolongations from the partitions separating the peripheral part of the whole into segments; _d_, spaces between the alae and in continuity with the chambers at the periphery of the whorl; _e_, chambers at periphery of the successive whorls.

The parts are emphasised, but can be seen in photo, by using a lens.

N.B. The spiral coils and willow pattern seen respectively in horizontal and vertical sections are precisely the same as are found in typical Nummulites.

## Introduction

The discovery of the original organic nature of the igneous rocks was led up to by finding that _Eozoon_ was a Stromatoporoid,* _i.e._ a colonial nummulite. Accordingly it is essential to give a brief preliminary account of _Eozoön canadense_ (see Chapter 1.).

*) Στρῶμα layer, πὁρος pore, Stromatoporoids being formed of organically connected _layers_ of nummulites, each shell having a _central perforation_, the umbilicus. The name was given to certain Palaeozoic fossils having a "layered" structure and peculiar pores on the surface. Many theories have been put forward to explain the nature of these layers and pores.

The mere mention of the name of the Dawn Animal seems not infrequently to excite violent igneous action, a phenomenon which should not be evoked unnecessarily. With a sense of the responsibility incurred, I do not hesitate to declare that now there is convincing evidence as to the real nature of that organism around which so much controversy has raged. The modern scientific world is almost unanimous in its belief that _Eozoön_* is of purely mineral origin. In a memoir on the "Azoic System," two writers refer* to the "extraordinary delusion which has prevailed among palaeontologists with reference to the organic nature of _Eozoön_." Such delusions, in the case of those possessed by them, are charitably assumed to be supplemented by the desire to do something sensational. The _coup de grâce_ is supposed to be given to the organic theory because certain writers seem to have carried their conclusions to absurd lengths. Dr. Otto Hahn, who wrote about the organisms found in meteorites and on the vegetable nature of _Eozoön_, comes in for special mention. But, as Herbert Spencer observed ('First Principles,' _ed._ 1884, p. 568), when he was being baited by hostile critics, there is an essential difference "between intrinsic absurdity and extrinsic absurdity."*

*) _Eozoön_ is a word of four syllables.

*) _Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool._ Harvard, 1884, 7. p. 534. J. D. Whitney and M. E. Wadsworth. "The Azoic System."

*) I have found Dr. Hahn's writings very interesting. He was nearer the truth than were his critics. He regarded _Eozoön_, granite, meteorites, _etc._, as mainly composed of plants. The branching canals of _Eozoön_ are consigned to several genera of algae. Dr. Hahn did not allow for the changes produced by mineralisation. The oogonia of "Chilocarpon" shown on Pl. 10. of "Die Urzelle" are probably young nummulite buds, the supposed cell-nuclei being pores or septal apertures. The umbilicus is shown in each bud.

Then, again, these writers accuse zoologists and palaeontologists of entire ignorance as to the great variety of forms occurring in the mineral kingdom, forms "which it only requires an imaginative temperament to endow with the attributes of organic structure." That may be so, but I sometimes find in petrologists a lack of knowledge of the variety of forms of organic life, and a tendency to mistake organic structures, - as, for example, the branching pseudopodial canals of _Eozoön_ - for purely mineral formations. They are so engrossed in the difficult study of the mineralogical characters of rocks that they seem unwilling to regard these objects from other points of view. It almost irritates them to see a zoologist prying about with a magnifying glass, apparently with nefarious designs on their property. They resent the suggestion that about half their territory should be annexed by palaeontology, and naturally they are impatient when they see some palaeontologist trespassing in their galleries and asking to look at the volcanic rocks representing the types of _Eozoön atlanticum, pacificum, etc._*

*) In presenting to the British Museum the collection of rocks I made at Madeira and Porto Santo Island, I shall be confronted with a dilemma more perplexing than one which Solomon had to face on a certain occasion. When he was called upon to settle a dispute between two women as to the ownership of a babe he had a simple problem to deal with, for the child actually belonged to one of the claimants. I am in doubt, however, how to settle the rival claims of the mineralogical and palaeontological departments. For the specimens are examples of _Eozoön_ (or _Stromatopora_) _atlanticum_ in the form of lava, basalt, trachyte, granitoid rock, _etc._ Perhaps the best solution will be to cut the collection into two halves.

Evidently, what the above quoted authors did not see is not to be allowed to exist, and anyone who dares assert that he finds evidence of the former existence of organic structure in igneous rocks will incur Athanasian penalties, and his book will be entered on the said authors' "Index" of "gems."

I believe that many conclusions of these writers are based on _a priori_ conceptions. They write (_l.c._ p. 526) "rocks must necessarily be azoic, when formed or originating under such conditions as were incompatible with life." Certainly this conclusion must be accepted. Then they go on to say, "The original crust of the earth must have been azoic, if we adopt the views held by the large majority of geologists that our globe has cooled down from a former condition of igneous fluidity. The volcanic and eruptive rocks must necessarily be azoic because they have come from the heated interior of the globe, reaching the surface in a melted condition. We do not, however, designate the eruptive and volcanic rocks as 'Azoic'; the fact that they are necessarily in this condition is assumed as something self-evident." On the contrary the original _organic_ nature of these rocks is to me self-evident, because I can see the Foraminiferal structure in them, and often very clearly indeed. There is no need, I believe, to bring the nature of the earth's interior into the question. The igneous rocks are mainly masses of crystallised silicates. Numerous fossils of later age, with skeletons originally consisting of pure calcium carbonate become masses of silica. The earliest formed Foraminiferal rocks often became changed into silica compounds. After this change had taken place, there came periods of disturbance of the earth's crust, owing to the cooling and contraction of the warm sphere in its medium of cold space. The compression and re-adjustment of the crust caused a rise in temperature sufficient to reduce to a more or less molten state the silicated limestones, but in spite of this the intractable Foraminiferal medals often retain to a considerable extent their arrangement and pattern, as can be seen by careful and patient observation.

The supposed Azoic crust of the earth is Eozoic down to its known foundations and is, as Dana stated, "the only universal formation." The known part of the earth's "rind" is only a pellicle a few miles thick, and what is that in comparison with the diameter of the globe?

The above remarks are not written in an aggressive spirit. I believe 'The Azoic System'* to be a splendid piece of work reflecting great credit on the authors, but I am now in a position to say with certainty that they are mistaken in their opinion that _Eozoön canadense_ is of purely mineral origin. They and the scientific world in general are not to be blamed for their error, for correct ideas concerning the structure of _Eozoön_ have only recently been arrived at. I find that I myself, in spite of having had exceptional opportunities for learning the truth, have misinterpreted the character and orientation of the coiled disks of which this colonial Foraminiferan is built up, and one of the objects of this paper is to correct the mistake.

*) According to my observations there is no "Azoic" System. I hope that in place of "breathing out threatenings and slaughter" against heretical "Eozoists," believers in the Azoic doctrine will now become apostles of the organic theory. The term "Eozoic" is to be preferred to "Archaean," introduced by Dana.

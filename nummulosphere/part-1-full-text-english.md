## Introduction

The discovery of the original organic nature of the igneous rocks was led up to by finding that _Eozoon_ was a Stromatoporoid,* _i.e._ a colonial nummulite. Accordingly it is essential to give a brief preliminary account of _Eozoön canadense_ (see Chapter 1.).

*) Στρῶμα layer, πὁρος pore, Stromatoporoids being formed of organically connected _layers_ of nummulites, each shell having a _central perforation_, the umbilicus. The name was given to certain Palaeozoic fossils having a "layered" structure and peculiar pores on the surface. Many theories have been put forward to explain the nature of these layers and pores.

The mere mention of the name of the Dawn Animal seems not infrequently to excite violent igneous action, a phenomenon which should not be evoked unnecessarily. With a sense of the responsibility incurred, I do not hesitate to declare that now there is convincing evidence as to the real nature of that organism around which so much controversy has raged. The modern scientific world is almost unanimous in its belief that _Eozoön_* is of purely mineral origin. In a memoir on the "Azoic System," two writers refer* to the "extraordinary delusion which has prevailed among palaeontologists with reference to the organic nature of _Eozoön_." Such delusions, in the case of those possessed by them, are charitably assumed to be supplemented by the desire to do something sensational. The _coup de grâce_ is supposed to be given to the organic theory because certain writers seem to have carried their conclusions to absurd lengths. Dr. Otto Hahn, who wrote about the organisms found in meteorites and on the vegetable nature of _Eozoön_, comes in for special mention. But, as Herbert Spencer observed ('First Principles,' _ed._ 1884, p. 568), when he was being baited by hostile critics, there is an essential difference "between intrinsic absurdity and extrinsic absurdity."*

*) _Eozoön_ is a word of four syllables.

*) _Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool._ Harvard, 1884, 7. p. 534. J. D. Whitney and M. E. Wadsworth. "The Azoic System."

*) I have found Dr. Hahn's writings very interesting. He was nearer the truth than were his critics. He regarded _Eozoön_, granite, meteorites, _etc._, as mainly composed of plants. The branching canals of _Eozoön_ are consigned to several genera of algae. Dr. Hahn did not allow for the changes produced by mineralisation. The oogonia of "Chilocarpon" shown on Pl. 10. of "Die Urzelle" are probably young nummulite buds, the supposed cell-nuclei being pores or septal apertures. The umbilicus is shown in each bud.

Then, again, these writers accuse zoologists and palaeontologists of entire ignorance as to the great variety of forms occurring in the mineral kingdom, forms "which it only requires an imaginative temperament to endow with the attributes of organic structure." That may be so, but I sometimes find in petrologists a lack of knowledge of the variety of forms of organic life, and a tendency to mistake organic structures, - as, for example, the branching canals of _Eozoön_ - for purely mineral formations. They are so engrossed in the difficult study of the mineralogical characters of rocks that they seem unwilling to regard these objects from other points of view. It almost irritates them to see a zoologist prying about with a magnifying glass, apparently with nefarious designs on their property. They resent the suggestion that about half their territory should be annexed by palaeontology, and naturally they are impatient when they see some palaeontologist trespassing in their galleries and asking to look at the volcanic rocks representing the types of _Eozoön atlanticum, pacificum, etc._*

*) In presenting to the British Museum the collection of rocks I made at Madeira and Porto Santo Island, I shall be confronted with a dilemma more perplexing than one which Solomon had to face on a certain occasion. When he was called upon to settle a dispute between two women as to the ownership of a babe he had a simple problem to deal with, for the child actually belonged to one of the claimants. I am in doubt, however, how to settle the rival claims of the mineralogical and palaeontological departments. For the specimens are examples of _Eozoön_ (or _Stromatopora_) _atlanticum_ in the form of lava, basalt, trachyte, granitoid rock, _etc._ Perhaps the best solution will be to cut the collection into two halves.

Evidently, what the above quoted authors did not see is not to be allowed to exist, and anyone who dares assert that he finds evidence of the former existence of organic structure in igneous rocks will incur Athanasian penalties, and his book will be entered on the said authors' "Index" of "gems."

I believe that many conclusions of these writers are based on _a priori_ conceptions. They write (_l.c._ p. 526) "rocks must necessarily be azoic, when formed or originating under such conditions as were incompatible with life." Certainly this conclusion must be accepted. Then they go on to say, "The original crust of the earth must have been azoic, if we adopt the views held by the large majority of geologists that our globe has cooled down from a former condition of igneous fluidity. The volcanic and eruptive rocks must necessarily be azoic because they have come from the heated interior of the globe, reaching the surface in a melted condition. We do not, however, designate the eruptive and volcanic rocks as 'Azoic'; the fact that they are necessarily in this condition is assumed as something self-evident." On the contrary the original _organic_ nature of these rocks is to me self-evident, because I can see the Foraminiferal structure in them, and often very clearly indeed. There is no need, I believe, to bring the nature of the earth's interior into the question. The igneous rocks are mainly masses of crystallised silicates. Numerous fossils of later age, with skeletons originally consisting of pure calcium carbonate become masses of silica. The earliest formed Foraminiferal rocks often became changed into silica compounds. After this change had taken place, there came periods of disturbance of the earth's crust, owing to the cooling and contraction of the warm sphere in its medium of cold space. The compression and re-adjustment of the crust caused a rise in temperature sufficient to reduce to a more or less molten state the silicated limestones, but in spite of this the intractable Foraminiferal medals often retain to a considerable extent their arrangement and pattern, as can be seen by careful and patient observation.

The supposed Azoic crust of the earth is Eozoic down to its known foundations and is, as Dana stated, "the only universal formation." The known part of the earth's "rind" is only a pellicle a few miles thick, and what is that in comparison with the diameter of the globe?

The above remarks are not written in an aggressive spirit. I believe 'The Azoic System'* to be a splendid piece of work reflecting great credit on the authors, but I am now in a position to say with certainty that they are mistaken in their opinion that _Eozoön canadense_ is of purely mineral origin. They and the scientific world in general are not to be blamed for their error, for correct ideas concerning the structure of _Eozoön_ have only recently been arrived at. I find that I myself, in spite of having had exceptional opportunities for learning the truth, have misinterpreted the character and orientation of the coiled disks of which this colonial Foraminiferan is built up, and one of the objects of this paper is to correct the mistake.

*) According to my observations there is no "Azoic" System. I hope that in place of "breathing out threatenings and slaughter" against heretical "Eozoists," believers in the Azoic doctrine will now become apostles of the organic theory. The term "Eozoic" is to be preferred to "Archaean," introduced by Dana.

Since the personal factor has to be taken into consideration I would mention that for many years I have been in charge of one of the most important collections of Foraminifera in existence. Further, I have observed igneous phenomena of the volcanic kind in action in various parts of the world, _viz._, Italy, Sicily, Lipari Islands, Java and Teneriffe, and know something of their effects. I once spent nearly three days and a night on the summit of Stromboli, and there learned how various were the phenomena comprised under the term "igneous action."

It has taken over eighty years to settle the problem of the nature of Stromatoporoids. Almost by accident, I discovered the clue to the labyrinth, by noting the systems of Foraminiferal chambers coiled each round its respective umbilicus, and found that these myterious fossils were colonial Foraminifera built up of nummulitic shells. I little realised at the time the developments that would follow, and that the clue to the nature of _Eozoön_ and of the igneous rocks had been found. Again, it has taken fifty years to settle the _Eozoön_ problem, simply because an important link in the chain of evidence, _viz._, that of the coiled Foraminiferal shell, was missing. There is no need, then, to suspect that the theory here expounded is like Jonah's gourd. It will be found that the Stromatoporoid theory is based on very solid foundations.

If the statements here put forward concerning the origin of igneous rocks are doubted, I can only repeat what Desmarest used to say to importunate Neptunians, "Go and see."* If again it should be thought that the nummulitic disk is a phantom, I ask how does it come about that I am able by its means to solve, as I believe, important problems in palaeontology. For the disks have furnished the clue to the mystery* of the Dolomitic and Oolitic Limestones. It was a specimen of _Eozoön canadense_ that led me on to the solution of the problem of the Jurassic Oolites.

*) Quoted in Lyell's 'Principles of Geology,' ed. 12., vol. 1. p. 72.

*) The word "mystery" is used, because many of the limestones formed during the successive eras have been regarded hiterto simply as limestones.

As as result of many thousands of observations I have found that the plutonic rocks are metamorphosed nummulitic limestones silicated,* reduced to a more or less molten condition, and crystallized, and that volcanic rocks have had an identical origin with the plutonic. Certain Ordovician, Liassic, Permian and Jurassic limestones are also nummulitic, the Dolomitic being dolomitised, and Oolitic scarcely altered chemically.

*) A term used in a general sense to include change into silicates of various kinds, _viz._ of alumina, magnesium, with soda, potash, silica, iron, _etc._ "Silicified" implies conversion into silica.

Several writers have described traces of organic structure in igneous rocks, but they have failed to convince anyone as to the soundness of their observations, but the fact of the nummulitic nature of these rocks will soon, I believe, be generally admitted, and fortunately it is possible for anyone to look into the matter himself, the only equipment necessary being patient observation and a good lens magnifying 10 diameters.

The disks may be seen separate, or overlapping obliquely in rows, or as rouleaux in vertical section. They may be closely pressed together and flattened out like rolled oats. Each disk will show _en face_ the central umbilicus, a concentric and radial pattern, and frequently rows of pores. On vertical section the very minute regular network pattern, apparently formed by the edges of alar prolongations and septa, will be visible on each side of the umbilicus. I have observed all these structures in many igneous, Jurassic oolitic and Permian dolomitic rocks. Sometimes I have found it necessary to examine a fragment of rock with the closest scrutiny for hours before convincing myself that I have seen all the above-mentioned details. In the end I have come across structures that cannot possibly have arisen from a mere chance agglomeration of particles, but which must be the expression of original organic structure. The disks are usually best seen in a good side light from above. A bright light shining directly on the piece of rock that is being examined is apt to bring into relief the particles or grains which make up the Foraminiferal medals rather than the medals themselves. Impressionist pictures, when too closely viewed in a glare of light, show unduly the blobs of paint rather than the picture. A close scrutiny of the rocks is desirable, however, in all lights, direct and oblique, bright and less bright.

As regards methods, I carefully examine pieces of rock, firstly with the naked eye, then with an aplanatic lens magnifying 10 diameters, then with a Zeiss binocular magnifying 20 to 70 diameters, and lastly in thick and thin sections with high powers.

The lens is the most ready and satisfactory. For generally one is dealing with altered, ruined, and blasted structures, which are easier seen as objects of three dimensions than in thin sections.

My views on igneous and certain other rocks have been received with a good deal of scepticism, and this is not surprising. For here, almost at our doors is a new continent, the existence of which has never been suspected. I first sighted the new land in September 1912 (when I found that the Palaeozoic Stromatoporoids were colonial Foraminifera and in that _Eozoön_ was a Stromatoporoid). What at first appeared to be an island turns out to be a continent. It is not to be wondered at that I, who say so, am looked upon as a Munchausen, or as a person subject to delusions or entoptic troubles. For my part, I do not think it will be necessary to return to the theory that the Jurassic Oolites are made of grains of coral detritus derived from phantom coral reefs, or that certain Ordovician, Carboniferous and Permian (Dolomitic) limestones and igneous and gneissic rocks are of an indefinite nature.

I hope in course of time to issue a second part to this pamphlet, giving photographs, drawings and diagrams of nummulitic disks found in various rocks.

***

The design on the cover represents Neptune on the globe of waters. On one of the prongs of his trident is a piece of volcanic rock in the shape of a nummulitic disk, and in his hand is a meteorite. These emblems signify that Neptune's domain is enlarged not only at the expense of nether Jove, but also at that of high Jove whose supposed emblem of sovereignty - the thunderbolt - really belongs to the Sea God. The glow of volcanic fires results from the hammering (compression due to planetary shrinkage) of Neptune's material on the anvil of Vulcan. That it is Neptune's material that is being worked upon, is rendered clear by the image and superscription on the little medals or nummuli coined in the Sea God's mint, and easily to be deciphered by those skilled in this branch of numismatics. Neptune's bolt is poised ready to be hurled at rash and ignorant mortals of the type of the _a priori_ would-be refuter, daring to dispute the validity of his title-deeds.

The design which has been drawn by Mr. Highley, has been partly copied from prints in the British Museum.

In the course of this investigation I have received a great deal of information and many gifts of specimens from owners of quarries and of _depôts_ of stone, pumice and mica, who have shown me much kindness, which I very gratefully acknowledge. I wish especially to express my gratitude to Senhor A. C. Noronha, who gave me the fragments of volcanic rock that started me on the present enquiry.

I regret that I have not been able to marshal all my facts in strictly logical order, this failure being due to the continual cropping up of new discoveries after I had revised the first and second proofs of my pamphlet. Some allowance will, I trust, be made on account of the difficulties attending what may fairly be termed pioneer work in an almost unexplored territory.

## 1. On _Eozoön Canadense_ Dawson.

"A false theory, it is well known, may render us blind to facts which are opposed to our prepossessions, or may conceal from us their true import when we behold them." - Lyell, 'Principles of Geology,' ed. 12., vol. 2., p. 179.

I do not intend to enter here into details concerning the history of the _Eozoön_ controversy, and shall merely refer to a few of the more important points.

The original specimens of _Eozoön_ were found by the officers of the Geological Survey of Canada in the Lower Laurentian Limestone rocks about 1850-1858. These specimens had a layered aspect at their weathered edges; and a vertical section revealed alternating white and greenish-yellow bands. The white bands were found to be calcareous (calcite or dolomite) and the green bands siliceous (loganite, olivine, serpentine, _etc._). It seemed unlikely that any traces whatsoever of organic structure could exist in rocks of unimaginable antiquity, vastly older than the Cambrian, and in rocks which had been exposed to terrific metamorphosing agencies. As Sir W. Dawson observed, some of the gneisses between which the limestones were imbedded had been squeezed and twisted as if they had been put through a mangle. At the same time he and Sir W. Logan were struck with the resemblance between these layered and banded lumps of rock and the Palaeozoic Stromatoporoids. Accordingly Dawson concluded they were really fossils and gave them the name _Eozoön canadense_. Specimens were brought to London, and investigated by Dr. W. B. Carpenter, who endorsed the verdict of Dawson.

Carpenter regarded the greenish bands as chambers of a Foraminiferan, and the white bands as secondary skeleton. He described canals ramifying in the white bands and showed their similarity to the canals of the secondary skeleton of recent Foraminifera.

Specimens were now referred to Prof. Carl Möbius of Kiel, who had published several memoirs on Foraminifera.

He wrote a splendid monograph* on _Eozoön_ illustrated by eighteen beautiful plates, and his verdict was against the theory of organic origin. I was much struck with the fact that among the forty-seven figures illustrating the structure of _Eozoön_, I could only find one (Pl. 34. Fig. 44) which showed something that might possibly be regarded as evidence of organic structure. It is not to be wondered at that the distinguished Professor of Kiel was unable to accept the "organic" theory. If he had seen certain rings and coils in the branching canals, probably he would have hesitated before giving his verdict in favour of the mineral theory, and if he had seen under the microscope the young Foraminiferal shells shown in the Plate at the end of this pamphlet, he would most certainly have given the whole weight of his influence in support of the theory of organic origin.

*) 'Palaeontographica,' vol. 25., 1878, p. 175.

Professors Rowney and King of Galway likewise proceeded to demolish the theory of organic origin, and ransacked the mineral kingdom for minerals which appeared to show all the varieties of structure which Carpenter had found in _Eozoön_ and which he had brought forward as proofs of organic origin.

Later, Professors J. W. Gregory and Johnston-Lavis published a memoir on the Monte Somma bombs, which had a structure almost identical with that of _Eozoön_. Here apparently was the _coup de grâce_ to the organic theory. Was anyone going to be so insane as to assert that fossils retaining any trace of organic structure could be hurled up as bombs from a volcano?

In the _Annals_, October 1912, I stated that these bombs actually were examples of _Eozoön_, and so they undoubtedly are. I was mistaken in assuming that the broken down siliceous bands were composed of serpentine. At that time I had not read the authors' fine memoir on the Eozoonal structure of the ejected blocks of Monte Somma.*

*) The authors point out (_Trans. Roy. Dublin Soc._, 5., 1894, p. 266) that as regards the alternating silicate and calcite laminae the bombs completely resemble _Eozoön_. The silicate laminae are composed typically of peridote and spinel, and do not undergo serpentinisation. In the _Annals Mag._, October, 1912, p. 452, I recorded the finding of _Melobesia_ and of obscure traces of Polyzoa in a Monte Somma bomb. I have now confirmed this discovery. Two botanists to whom I showed a mounted fragment of the supposed alga, thought it resembled vegetable tissue. I have found traces of more than one species of Polyzoa. I remarked that the presence of these organisms seemed to point to the conclusion that Monte Somma had been under the sea, but it is not certain where the bomb came from. Professors Johnston-Lavis and Gregory state that most of the bombs are found among deposits of pumice forming a mantle round Monte Somma, especially amidst the material ejected during Phase 6 and Phase 7 (Plinian eruption A.D. 79). The bomb encrusted with organisms belongs to the Hamilton Collection in the Natural History Museum. Of course, it may have been picked up at some distance from Monte Somma, but I think not, because the encrusting organisms show traces of fusion, and must have been among hot scoriae, _etc._ So it is possible that before the historic period Monte Somma may have been submerged. If so, it would not be a very exceptional cirumstance. The columns of the Temple of Serapis, a few miles to the west, have been rising and falling frequently like a pressure gauge. When Vesuvius is quiet they rise, and after periods of activity they sink (Lyell, 'Principles,' ed. 12., 2., p. 171). The south-west base of Vesuvius from Portici to Torre del Annunziata is by the margin of the sea.

Scientific men were now satisfied that _Eozoön_ was an object of purely mineral origin, and were probably thankful to have the matter settled. In none of the standard works (Zittel, Steinmann, Hartog, Lister, Geikie, Bütschli), is _Eozoön_ accepted as an organism.

Sir Archibald Geikie ('Text-Book of Geology,' ed. 4., 1903, p. 879) maintained a position of judicious reserve amidst the clash of opposing views. Möbius had stated that the canals and passages were infiltration veinings of serpentine in calcite. Geikie pointed out, however, that sometimes the canal-systems are filled in with dolomite, and therefore must have been hollow before either serpentine or dolomite were introduced; and, further, he observed that no structure precisely similar to that of some specimens of _Eozoön_ had been discovered. On the other hand, he demanded that evidence brought forward in support of the organic theory should be clear and indubitable.

In the course of an investigation of the _Monticuliporoids_, I was led to examine the group of Palaeozoic fossils known as Stromatoporoids (layered pore animals). I found in them certain rings with signet-like swellings shaped somewhat like the siliceous rings of the siliceous sponge, _Merlia normani_, and I concluded that Stromatoporoids were sponges. But presently I found similar bodies in recent Foraminifera, and soon saw many reasons for believing that these fossils belonged to that group. On examining Dr. Carpenter's sections of _Eozoön_, I was amazed to find the rings there also.

I published a paper on _Eozoön_ and _Stromatoporoids_ in the _Annals and Mag. Nat. Hist._, September 1912, stating that they were Foraminifera. I found in all of them a complicated arrangement of chambers with calcareous walls perforated by tubuli and canals, and also rings and hoops similar to those of the modern Foraminifera. At this stage I held the same views of _Eozoön_ as Carpenter, who regarded the olivine bands as models of Foraminiferal chambers.

In October 1912 I published in the same journal a paper containing several errors,* but also a very important* truth. I found that Stromatoporoids and _Eozoön_ were composed of layers of Foraminiferal shells organically united so as to form colonies. I thought at first that the shells of Stromatoporoids were Rotalian in character, and sometimes of large size with great coils of segments, but I have since found that the shells resemble those of _Eozoön_ in being typical nummulites with alar prolongations,* and in being on an average less than 5 millimetres (1/5 of an inch) in diameter. The large spiral and cyclical patterns seen on the polished slabs of some species of Stromatoporoids do not belong to single large shells, but to series of small ones. Similary the long parallel bands are vertical or oblique sections of rouleaux of shells. A x10 lens will show the disks all over the surface of _Stromatopora_, _Actinostroma_, _Beatricea_, _Labechia_, _etc._ The tubercles in specimens of the last-named genus are simply the effect of metamorphosing agencies, and I do not think the genus will stand. The Caunopora tubes belong to foreign organisms such as worms and corals.

*) When first examining the surface of a large specimen of _Eozoön canadense_, I saw branching tuft-like structures and spreading crusts, which appeared to me to be coralline algae, and to which I gave provisional names. I have found since that these supposed algae are - possibily with one exception - purely mineral structures. Certain opaque white incrustations with rounded edges, and apparently with a cellular structure may, however, be Melobesia-like algae.  
Hitherto I have only had half a dozen cleaned specimens of _Eozoön_ to work with. I have asked a colleague in Ottawa to superintend the despatch to London of a quarter of a ton of Lower Laurentian Limestone, and some graphite and gneiss in the rough, and am hopeful of finding remains of Eozoic flora, if they exist.  
In the _Annals_, October, 1912, I figured a network of pseudopods, but I find this appearance to be due to a breaking down of Eozoon-structure in olivine. Again, the growth of _Eozoön_ might be compared to a nearly sessile mushroom, but not to a fountain. Lastly, there is no evidence that the _Rotaliidae_ are derived from Stromatoporoids.

*) I think this adjective correctly describes the first of a series of observations that culminated in the discovery of the "nummulosphere" on which, strange to relate, we have been living all this time _sans le savoir_.

*) A term designating the centripetal V-shaped prolongations of a coil embracing the previously formed coils.

On the surface of specimens of _Eozoön_, if not too much crystallized, it is easy to find plenty of disks with umbilicus and radial rows of pores. Where the surface of a shell has been damaged the alae and septa can be detected.

The arrangement of disks in _Stromatopora_ and _Eozoön_ might be compared ideally with a number of vertical piles of coins, each coin having a central hole (astrorhiza or umbilicus). A Stromatoporoid approaching this ideal arrangement is found in _Receptaculites_ with its well-marked columns and fairly regular surface pattern.

A vertical section of _Eozoön_ frequently shows alternating wavy white and green bands, and curious branching canals in the white parts.

Carpenter was under the impression that a specimen of _Eozoön_ was a monster Foraminiferal shell with huge chambers arranged in layers separated by thick white bands of secondary skeleton permeated by branching canal-systems. He compared the enormously large "chambers" to those of _Polytrema_, and described them as having "grown wild," meaning thereby that they had escaped control of some spiral pattern and had become "acervuline." He regarded _Eozoön_ as a member of the _Nummulitidae_ because he thought it possessed those types of structure, _viz._ secondary skeleton and canal-system that are developed to a corresponding degree only in the higher members of that family. Brady evidently influenced by Carpenter, placed _Eozoön_ in a new sub-family of the _Nummulitidae_, _viz._, "sub-family 5 (?) _Eozoöninae_ - test forming irregular, adherent acervuline masses." "_Eozoön_ Dawson - test adherent, outlines irregular; composed of segments arranged at first in more or less regular superimposed layers, subsequently acervuline; with interseptal skeleton and ramifying canals."

It happens to be true that _Eozoön_ belongs to the _Nummulitidae_, but neither Carpenter nor Brady bring forward any evidence in support of this theory. For certainly the green spaces are not Foraminiferal chambers in any sense, the white bands are not secondary skeleton, and the dendritic structures are not pseudopodial canals.

No wonder the theory of organic origin has not been accepted by the scientific world! I can now clearly understand why Möbius and the mineralogists summarily rejected the theory of the organic origin of _Eozoön_. For it is easily conceivable that a mass of carbonate of lime of wholly inorganic origin like, for instance, a "fur" deposited from heated water might become dolomitised and silicated in zones, and the dolomite (or calcite) zones might become penetrated by branched veinings of silicates. Then the opponents of the organic theory might well point out the improbability of the survival of any trace of organic structure in very ancient rocks which had been subjected to terrific metamorphosing agencies. Again, when Eozoonal rocks were hurled up from the crater of a volcano, there was surely no need for further discussion. One might as well argue with an "earth-flattist" as with a person who stated that _Eozoön_ had once been a living organism. The history of this controversy, however, presents only one more instance of the danger of _a priori_ reasoning, for simple observation with a hand-lens shows beyond the least shadow of doubt that not only _Eozoön_ but the volcanic and plutonic rocks are mineralized organic structures.

A specimen of _Eozoön_ was once a mass of delicate hollow shells of carbonate of lime. The white and green bands in metamorphosed specimens are simply the result of a particular mode of mineralization* of this uniform mass. The convincing proof is that the nummulite shells are present both in the white and in the green bands. Even where the banded structure is well marked, the white and green layers vary greatly in thickness, and often there are large non-banded areas of white or green, and sometimes of mottled green and white. Often, too, the individual shells are composed partly of olivine and partly of dolomite. Doubtless the wholly calcareous Tudor specimen of _Eozoön_ is simply a mass of calcareous shells. A glance with a lens would settle the point. In banded trachytes there are shells in the white felspar layers and also in the earthy-brown layers, and sometimes one can see several very fine dark bands traversing one shell. In some granites, too, I often see quartz felspar andmica in a single shell. The green bands are not Foraminiferal chambers, but silicated areas each containing several nummulite shells or portions of shells, just as the dolomitised areas may each contain several shells or parts of shells.

*) It was only after this pamphlet was in the press that I realized that "mineralize" and "crystallize," _etc._, are spelled with a "z," and "dike" with an "i" in Murray, our final authority.

In 1878 Nicholson and Etheridge found certain curious labyrinthine masses of vermiculate tubes in microscopic sections of Girvan limestone. They regarded them as organisms allied to the arenaceous Foraminifera, and gave them the name _Girvanella problematica_. These objects have since been found in other limestones, especially in the Jurassic Oolites. I have found that the Girvan limestones and Oolites are nummulitic rocks, and that the Girvanella structures are simply the results of partial solution and redeposition in the hollow calcareous nummulite shells with their coil-within-coil structure. Although the chambers of any particular coil extend from the periphery to the centre, it is only the peripheral part just within the apex of the V that occupies much space, the rest of the chamber-space being the thin film between the alae or arms of the V and the outer surface of the next coil embraced by those arms. Consequently there is a tendency to the formation of series of concentric tubes. Further, the series of radiating septa of all the coils lie to a considerable extent along similar vertical radial planes, a fact rendered obvious when one views a horizontal section of a nummulite through the median plane. Consequently when a shell is subject to pressure there is a tendency for there radial septa to cut out, so to speak, a radial pattern. Again, horizontal, vertical and oblique sections through rouleaux of shells would show a complicated plexus of tubes. It is not difficult to realize that when subjected to dissolving agencies single shells or groups of shells may form little isolated granules, or big pisolitic masses. One thing is certain, _viz._ that the Girvan limestone of Tramitchel is a mass of nummulites, and that these shells undergo change from the effects of rain water and carbonic acid. Further, it is possible to trace nummulitic structures in masses of Girvanella. I believe Girvanella structure will be found in nummulitic rocks from granite to the Upper Chalk and possibly later.

I now find this structure abundantly in the dolomitised silicated masses of nummulitic limestone known as _Eozoön_. The supposed branching canals in the supposed secondary skeleton of _Eozoön_ are simply "Grivanella" structures. They exist also in the green silicated parts of specimens. Gradations can be traced from circular nummulite shells with radiating "tubes," through closely pressed fan-shaped masses, to widely branched spread-out canal systems. It is simply a matter of breaking down of shells, of masses of tubes, and of joining up into hollow canal systems like the heading-off of river systems. Naturally the silication has been effected more readily in those parts of the dolomite bands where hollow channels have formed as the result of the peculiar mode of disintegration that takes place in the nummulite shells. The peculiar "rings" seen in the canals are there because they have been present in the original shells. I do not think they are purely the product of mineralization becuase similar structures exist in recent Foraminifera. The rings and half-rings visible in decalcified preparations of spirit specimens of _Polytrema_ appear to be horny thickenings in the neighbourhood of the rims of pseudopodial pores. If this be so, a series might form along vertical rows of pores in nummulites, in which there are numerous successive layers of shell-wall especially at the central parts of the shell. The existence of these bodies in _Eozoön_ and the later Stromatoporoids may be due to mineralization of the rings, or again, the rings may have been calcareous skeletal thickenings of pore-rims. Whatever be their nature and origin, it was the finding of them in _Eozoön_ that first led me to doubt, possibly on a wrong premiss, the theory of mineral origin of that structure.

I cannot find a single point of zoological difference between _Eozoön canadense_ Dawson and _Stromatopora concentrica_ Goldfuss. In both there are layers of nummulite shells of the same structure and size. As this is not a systematic treatise, I shall continue to call the Canadian Dawn Animal by its well-known name.

Although the highest type of Foraminiferal organisation is reached in the family _Nummulitidae_, owing to the development of a secondary skeleton in the walls and between the septa of the shell, yet the Stromatoporoid type of nummulite is a simple one, for the thin-walled shell consists merely of a continuous and embracing spiral coil divided up into similar segments. Further, while growth in the horizontal plane produces the coil, growth in the vertical leads to the formation of a bud which simply repeats the horizontal and vertical modes of growth.

The individuality of certain types of Stromatoporoids is well-marked in the branching forms, and in _Beatricea_ and _Receptaculites_. The shape of massive forms such as _Stromatopora concentrica_ and _Eozoön_ is not so well-defined. Similary in corals, specimens vary greatly in the degree of definiteness of their shape. The Jurassic Oolites and Chalk are probably mainly masses of Stromatoporoids, yet it is not possible to define the shapes of specimens, nor even of reefs.

***

On p. 93 (summary) I state that _Eozoön_ differs from Palaeozoic forms in possessing a secondary skeleton. This statement is erroneous and should be deleted.

***

I am certain that the long and, at times, bitter controversy on the nature of _Eozoön_ is finally settled, and it is now possible to see that both sides were right and both wrong. The believers in the organic theory were right although they failed to bring forward satisfactory proofs,* but the upholders of the mineral theory were fully justified in rejecting the theory of organic origin until those proofs were forthcoming.

*) It must not be forgotten, however, that Dawson, Logan and Carpenter pointed out the external resemblance between _Eozoön_ and the Palaeozoic Stromatoporoids, about the organic nature of which there was no dispute.

_Miscellaneous addenda._ - The timely discovery of the real nature of the white bands in _Eozoön_ necessitated the rewriting of the chapter. To fill a vacant space a few notes are added.

_Note 1._ I have now found that mica is wholly composed of tremendously compressed masses of nummulites. In fairly thick laminae it is often possible to see abundantly the circular groups of scales, pores, umbilicus, _etc._, and occasionally at the edges of laminae the willow pattern and the minute reticulation formed by alae and septa. Mica is probably a remnant product, silica and other silicates having disappeared.

_Note 2._ In Prof. C. Gagel's memoir on the petrology of Madeira (Zeitsch. deutsch. geolog. Gesellch. Bd. 64, Hft. 3, 1912, p. 434, Fig. 19) a micro-photograph (x50) of a section of trachydolerite is shown. The section is that of a resorbed amphibole which has become changed into magnetite dust and rhonite crystals. With the aid of a lens I can see in the lower dark part of the figure the circular outlines of masses of very small nummulite disks looming through the cross-hatch, the disks being 3-6 mm. in diameter in the figure. A petrological friend showed me a crystal of hornblende breaking down. Each magnetite crystal at the periphery of the hornblende crystal formed the centre of a flake, apparently of felspar. The clear yellow central part of the large crystal also was faintly aerolated, with a dark spot in each aerola. The aerolar pattern apparently is that which has been cut out by the septa and successive coil-rims of a much altered nummulite shell. Compare also the (?) haematite intra-cameral particles in limestone shells. Apparently ferric and ferrous granules have become ferroso-ferric magnetite-dust.

_Note 3._ A specimen of Zechstein (dolomite) from Nieder-Rodenbach (in my own possession) is apparently not the original dolomite, but a dolomitic sedimentary shale.

_Note 4._ Concerning R. Mallet's theory that the melting of igneous rocks is due to compression, I beg to submit a very humble personal observation. I asked a blacksmith to hammer a bar of iron on an anvil. In a few seconds the hammered end was too hot for me to touch, and in less than a minute, for the blacksmith himself to handle. The arm of the mightiest mortal blacksmith is feeble beside that of the tireless Vulcan. It seems a curious paradox that the cooling of the earth should lead to the melting of the rocks!

_Note 5._ Sands and muds which I gathered at Sandwich and Cuckmere have now dried and hardened, and the nummulitic structure, difficult to detect in the moist state, is now easily to be seen.

## 2. Porto Santo and Madeira.

"Neptune, besides the sway  
Of every salt flood, sand each ebbing stream,  
Took in by lot 'twixt high and nether Jove  
Imperial rule of all the sea-girt isles,  
That like to rich and various gems inlay  
The unadornéd bosom of the deep;" Comus.

In September 1912 I journeyed to Porto Santo via Madeira, in order to complete my investigation of that strange organism, the Sponge-alga _Merlia normani_.

Going from Madeira to Porto Santo - and I have now made the journey four times - seems to me like making a trip from the earth to the moon. The little island, which lies about 20 miles N.E. of Madeira, is about six miles long and one to four miles broad. There are numerous little mountains or picos, of which the highest is about 1500 feet. They form two groups with a low saddle, partly occupied by a great lava flow, between.

On the S.E. shore of the island, one of the Picos (P. Baixo) forms a magnificent triangular escarpment about 900 feet high. The summit is formed by a sharply defined triangular mass of greyish-white columnar trachyte; below this are dull red and purple bands of scoriae, and still lower a great basal mass of black columnar basalt coming down to the blue water and overlying at one place a Miocene coral reef, the ensemble producing an indescribably beautiful effect in the strangely transparent air. With the exception of certain tertiary coral reefs and some post-pleistocene blown sands the whole island is volcanic. The lines of dike-like crests of the mountains, if continued, would converge towards a point situated out at sea to the north of the island, where the crater of a huge volcano must have been. The dikes and lava streams show that Porto Santo Island is the base of the southern slope of the volcano, all the rest having disappeared possibly by submergence, for, judging from the soundings, the island was probably very much larger in former times than it is now.

One day my amiable and accomplished friend Senhor A. C. Noronha, who had accompanied me to the island, showed me some fragments of banded trachyte, basalt and granitoid rocks which he had collected at spots about 1000 feet up the Pico do Facho.

I examined them carefully under my binocular microscope and found to my amazement traces of nummulitic disks in all of them. Next day I visited the place whence the fragments had come.

They had been detached from the rocks laid bare in torrent beds. When I saw the huge boulders of banded trachyte, I thought I had made a mistake about the disks, but on returning to the village, I again found sure evidence of their existence.

After all I need not have been so doubtful about my first observations, for I remembered the account which Dr. G. Lindström gave of the huge masses and balls several feet in diameter of _Stromatopora discoidea_ which he had found in Gothland and which he considered to be corals, but which we now know to be colonial Formainifera closely allied to _Eozoön_.

Senhor Noronha showed me the spot where he had found the highly crystalline granitoid rock, _viz._, at the place of junction between a dike and the older basalt. I spent several days collecting rocks, and found that almost the whole island from the shore to the crests of the mountains was made of metamorphosed nummulitic limestone, and that the houses, the boundary walls of the fields, the boulders on the sea-shore, and to some extent the soil and the shore sands* were likewise composed of this material. A coarsely granular clay used for roofing small cottages also contained the disks, so that _Eozoön_ had at last arrived at the fate that might have befallen the dust of Imperial Caesar. Very interesting, too, were the kaolinised basaltic boulders, looking like chalk full of black pebbles, and in the final stage like pure chalk.

*) The shore sands of Porto Santo are mainly calcareous, but also there are present grains of what I believe to be greenish olivine. The waves sift the darker siliceous and lighter calcareous particles and make a curious banded structure which sometimes hardens. A boulder of this finely-banded material might be mistaken at first for a piece of banded volcanic rock. Of course, a glance with the lens reveals the real structure.

On my return to Madeira, I found that here also the volcanic rocks were made of changed nummulitic limestones.*

*) Accordingly, when Neptune took in by lot imperial rule of the volcanic isles, Chance sided with Justice, for volcanos and lavas are, in the main, altered Foraminiferal sea-floors, to which, surely, nether Jove has no claim.

At a spot about 2800 feet up the Pico do Infante, and near the house of my hospitable friend the Rev. A. D. Paterson, I saw a bed of huge balls of volcanic rock, varying in diameter from one to several feet. They were so badly weathered that it was possible to peel off large flakes. The balls are composed of basalt, and have been regarded as "bombs," which had been hurled up into the air and had fallen back into hot lava, thereby becoming recoated. This theory is probably incorrect, because the stones are on the mountain side, and not in a crater. Onion stones are not uncommon wherever volcanic rocks exist. The Madeira examples are in volcanic soil, _i.e._ in disintegrated volcanic rock.

R. Mallet (_Trans. Roy. Irish Acad._ 1837 [1839] p. 75) describes a trap rock in Galway, which fractures irregularly when struck with a hammer, but which reveals a _hidden nodular structure_ when blasted with gunpowder. He compares the blasting to the sculptor's chisel which (in the Greek fable) revealed the statue hidden in the marble. He notes the significant fact that certain visible crystals never went beyond the bounding surface of one nodule into another. Apparently a laminar structure must have existed in the rock before the crystals separated out. Probably the lamination in onion-stones is due to the effects of cooling.

In the case of the Madeira onion-stones percolating water and root fibrils appear to have worked along the zones of least resistance which had formed as a result of shrinkage in the cooling rock.

## 3. On the World-wide Distribution of Nummulitic Rocks.

On my return to London I made a petrological tour of the world in the Mineral Gallery of the Natural History Museum. I found that the volcanic rocks of the volcanic islands of the Atlantic, from Iceland to St. Helena, of the Arctic (Spitsbergen), Mediterranean (Etna, _etc._), Antarctic (Ross Island, Erebus and Terror), Indian Ocean (Kerguelen and Christmas Island) and Pacific (Fiji) were composed of metamorphosed nummulitic limestones. I next proceeded to examine plutonic rocks and many of the metamorphic ones (gneisses, some schists), and found that these were of the same nature. In a piece of garnetiferous schist which I gathered in the bed of a river in the Sikhim Himalayas, the nummulitic shells have become modelled in grains of garnet. In other parts of the fragment there are ordinary crystals of garnet, and mica. The specimen formed part of a huge boulder which my kind host, Mr. John C. White, the Resident, had caused to be blown up with dynamite.

I have examined the fragment of grey basalt dredged up by the _Challenger_ from 1950 fathoms from Lat. 53° 55' S. and Long. 108° 33' E., also two pieces of rock obtained by the telegraph engineers of ss. _Cambria_ from 2,200 to 2,530 fathoms in Lat. 51° 35' N. and Long. 15° 43' W. and Lat. 51° 34' N. and Long. 16° 30' W. and find them all to be changed limestones in which the shells are clearly visible. These blocks might have been dropped from icebergs, and possibly do not belong to the localities in which they were found. At the same time they may do so, more especially the two last specimens. Lastly, I firmly believe I have found the shells in many of the stony meteorites or aerolites, and even in siderolites.

The disks are, perhaps, better seen in basalts than in the highly crystalline granites, and better in homogeneous than in vesicular lavas, in which last it is almost impossible to find them. I have not been able to detect them in certain volcanic bombs in which the lava has been reduced almost to a homogeneous paste.

The difference between the _Eozoön_* of the Lower Laurentian Limestones, and the _Eozoön_ of a granite or gneiss is due to the fact that the former was modified to a less extent and in a different manner by metamorphosing agencies than the two latter.

*) Probably the Eozoic limestones are all composed of the _colonial_ nummulite of Stromatoporoid _Eozoön_.

***

I would advise those who may wish to look into the matter for themselves to examine igneous rocks carefully and thoroughly with a good lens magnifying ten diameters. At first there will be a generalised impression, and nothing but a confused mass of minerals will be seen, but the disk structure will gradually reveal itself. Usually the central umbilicus and the circular area of the disk will first be seen, and then traces of radial and concentric lines, and possibly radial series of pores. Gradually skill in detecting these structures will come, and with it, the possibility of orientating* the pieces of metamorphosed nummulitic rock, especially when a row of disks _en face_ or in rouleau is discovered. Of course it may not unreasonably be pointed out how easy it is to choose a centre and imagine a circle round it, _etc._, and that if the existence of a thing is strongly asserted, it will tend to become visible owning to the influence of suggestion. When the observer has seen the disks in many kinds of igneous rocks and gneisses, he will, I believe, refuse to accept the hypothesis that he is the victim of delusions.

*) A rock formed even of separate disks would tend to show a layered structure, but I believe the igneous rocks to be Stromatoporoids or _colonial_ nummulites, and therefore I use the term "orientating." If these rocks are colonial Foraminifera, the stromatic arrangement must be entirely destroyed in very liquid lavas - such, for example, as that referred to by J. D. Forbes (Occasional Papers, p. 93), which flowed down Vesuvius at a rate of a mile in 1'3 minutes, but yet the disks persist.

I have examined many kinds of non-Foraminiferal rocks, coarse sandstones, slags, grits, pseudomorphs, concretions, _etc._, in order to note whether the disk-structure presents itself, and occasionally I have met with appearances suggestive of that structure. In the case of igneous rocks and Stromatoporoid Limestones, however, it is not merely a question of disks, but of _Foraminiferal_ disks often more or less definitely orientated, and individually presenting a good deal of structure whether seen _en face_ or in vertical or oblique section.

It is desirable to approach the subject with an open mind. A sympathetic attitude is still better, and will be rewarded with a rapid appreciation of an important truth. A disposition hostile to the new theory may, I am afraid, lead the observer to underestimate the value of even very clear indications of organic pattern.

I myself have now made numerous observations on all varieties of plutonic, volcanic and gneissic rocks and can detect the disks and a certain degree of banded structure in all, even in examples of Aberdeen and Cornish granite. Rough or polished surfaces, but best of all, surfaces roughly fractured obliquely along the original planes of bedding will show the disks, sometimes _en face_, sometimes on edge or in section. When I examine a piece of grey Cornish De Lank granite about the size of my hand, and split obliquely I can after a time detect with a x10 lens a hundred subtle evidences of the indubitable fact that I am looking at a fragment of a silicated nummulitic rock. Mica, felspar or quartz may enter into the composition of the disks. The alar prolongations of the nummulitic shell are frequently modelled in series of thin layers of mica. The umbilicus is usually well differentiated, and rows of pores are often visible. It is desirable to put in a word of caution here, _viz._, not to mistake fine lines made with the "patent-axe" for indications of Stromatoporoid structure.

The mineralized medals or disks vary in diameter from about one-sixth to a third of an inch or more. It must be remembered that they are crushed and flattened structures pressed against each other, so that it is difficult to estimate how much of the whole original disk is seen in any particular example.

It is very difficult to detect the nummulitic structure in granites with very large crystals, or in Pegmatites. I have seen the disks, however, in a thin section of graphic granite from Harris. It was, I believe, this very section that Dr. Carpenter described as "A New Laurentian Fossil" (_Nature_, May 4, 1876, vol. 14, p. 8). Later (_l.c._ May 25, p. 68) he retracted, and explained that he had mistaken the feldspathic bands for calcareous ones. He was right after all in his first opinion. For at the junctions between the two kinds of crystals I can make out the Foraminiferal disks cut vertically and obliquely. They have wholly disappeared from the space occupied by the main width of each lamina. Carpenter writes, "... whether the graphic granite may not be a metamorphosed form of an ancient organic structure ... is not to be decided by anyone's _ipse dixit_."

Traces of the disks are visible in pumice, asbestos, jade, meerschaum in the rough state, soapstone, serpentine, verde antico, and precious porphyry.*

*) I am much indebted to Messrs. Farmer and Brindley for specimens of the two last named rocks.

Messrs. O'Hara and Hoar kindly permitted me to examine on their premises numerous examples of pumice from all parts of the world. I found the disk structure best in certain hard blocks, of very little use commercially. Here the gases had burst up through the mass in such a way as to bring out the coiled pattern of the disks fairly distinctly.

I was given a piece of clay called Turkey Green, and this I found to be a kaolinised igneous product showing evident traces of the disks. Again, I found faint traces of them in a pure white siliceous "chalk" which had been discovered under the soil in Spain. This "chalk," which contains over 80 per cent. of silica, is composed of diatoms, siliceous sponge-spicules shaped like bent rods pointed at each end, and nummulite disks. If the diatom-frustules and spicules are those of fresh-water organisms, the formation is probably an ancient lake-bottom, the disks being the detritus of nummulitic limestones carried down by rivers and deposited as mud amidst the falling diatom-frustules. In the Natural History Museum there is a similar chalk-like mass of rock from the floor of a lake in Australia. Here the diatoms are certainly fresh-water forms. The investigation of these siliceous rocks led me to examine the "Barbados Earth," a marine Miocene formation very rich in Radiolaria. This "earth" is essentially a nummulitic rock on the surface of which Radiolaria have continually fallen in the course of its growth. Although the carbonate of lime has gone, the nummulitic structure is well-preserved.

## 4. Geological and Geognostical Considerations.

Many men of science believe that the greater part of the land surface of the globe has been beneath the sea,* but the discovery of the nummulitic origin of igneous rocks tends to prove that at one time or another the whole area has been submarine.

The general distribution of igneous rocks and gneisses on or below the surface of the land, and the world-wide occurrence of volanic islands (or heaps of silicated Foraminiferal limestone) over all the oceans, appear to point to the conclusion that there was once a nearly universally distributed crust of nummulitic limestones.*

If, over great areas of the deep oceans, the floor beneath the oozes if formed of a relatively shallow-water Foraminiferan, there would probably have been a compensating rise over other areas of the general crust of the globe. Slow secular contraction due to slow secular cooling of the globe has been going on for immeasurable ages. It is not unreasonable to assume that the crust, during the early stages after consolidation, was more uniformly level, and that great depressions and elevations below and above a mean level came later. Possibly during the earlier part of the Eozoic Era there may have been a nearly or even wholly universal ocearn, relatively shallow over a great part of its area. It is, at any rate, almost certain that the ocean covered a much greater area than at present.

The Eozoic Era probably began at the moment when the planet had cooled down sufficiently to allow of the formation of the highly complex and unstable molecular combinations out of which protoplasm, the physical basis of life, is made. This substance must evidently have been formed on an immense scale. At first it must have had the plant mode of nutrition by means of solar energy, but portions of it took on the saprophytic and parasitic habit. A kind of widely spread Bathybius must have existed after all, and when that took to forming a skeleton of carbonate of lime, a colonial reef-forming Foraminiferan would gradually be evolved.

It is extremely probable that _Eozoön_ lived in shallow water, because an organism so extensively and abundantly distributed would require a plentiful food supply such as could be found only in shallow sunlit waters. Further, the Coral reefs of later epochs exist only in relatively shallow water. Again, I have found coralline algae growing on Palaeozoic Monticuliporas associated with Stromatoporoids, and it is unlikely that the Eozoic would differ greatly in bathymetric range from the Palaeozoic forms. Accordingly there is reason for believing that _Eozoön_ lived in the coralline zone. In course of time thick beds of Foraminiferal limestone were formed, and these underwent metamorphosis just as has happened in the case of many fossils in later ages.

The gradual shrinkage of the earth's crust would give rise to a great elevation of temperature, sufficient to fuse to a greater or less extent the silicated nummulitic rocks.

When I discovered that the igneous rocks which form a great part of the known crust of the earth were composed of altered nummulitic limestones, it became evident that igneous action could only be accounted for on the theory of shrinkage of the earth's crust, and that theories of chemical action or of interior heat and fluidity were out of the question.

After I had formulated on biological grounds a theory of shrinkage, it was a relief to find that Lord Kelvin and Robert Mallet had already concluded that "vulcanicity" could be wholly explained on the hypothesis that the earth is a cooling body with a contracting crust. (See Appendix, Note 6.)

Lord Kelvin writes ('On the Secular Cooling of the Earth,' Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh, 1862, 23. p. 160), "The less hypothetical view, however, that the earth is merely a warm chemically inert body is clearly to be preferred" - _i.e._ to theories of chemical action.

Again, R. Mallet ('Volcanic Energy. An attempt to develop its true Origin and Cosmical Relations.' Phil. Trans. 1873, p. 147, and 1875, p. 205) proves, on the supposition of a shell 800 miles thick, that the annual shrinkage due to secular cooling would amount to about 1'5 billionths of the total diameter, _i.e._ to a little less than 7 inches in 5,000 years. He writes, "Yet insignificant when thus measured as is the amount of annual contraction of our globe by its secular refrigeration, we see how important and mighty are its effects in preserving through the volcano the cosmical regimen of our world; it is another added to the many instances already known in the range of natural philosophy, in which causes so minute as for long to remain occult to us are yet, though unseen and unnoticed, essential parts of the mighty machine." Another hitherto unnoticed occult cause primarily contributing to the construction of the so-called igneous rocks has been the life force.

After the shrunk crust of the earth had re-adjusted itself for a time, the rocks would cool and crystallize. Where there were weak spots the crust would give way, and there would be an eruption, the force of which would often be increased by inroads of the sea.

At times, the relatively feeble force of gravity would be overcome and blocks of metamorphosed nummulitic limestones would be hurled into space with such violence that they would for a time escape control of terrestrial attraction and take on an orbit of their own, but would be captured later.*

*) During the eruption of Krakatoa a great part of the mountain was blown away, and the explosion was said to have been heard 3,000 miles away. Probably many meteorites would be ejected on such an occasion.

Dr. Otto Hahn,* the learned doctor of Tübingen, doubts whether any conclusion as to the origin of meteorites - "ob ... kinder oder brüder der Erde" - can be drawn from their chemical, morphological or textural characters. If, however, it is true that some aerolites are pieces of changed limestone, then it becomes difficult to imagine any other than a terrestrial origin for such bodies, and they would naturally be regarded as "kinder" or offspring.* Even some of the siderolites and siderites may be of terrestrial origin. For these bodies may have been formed just as iron from ironstone in a blast furnace. Some basalts (changed nummulitic limestones) are known to contain a good deal of iron, and this is only what might be expected, for all protoplasm contains this metal. Further, I often saw on the beach at Porto Santo boulders of trachyte with well-marked rusty, evidently ferruginous, bands. Igneous rocks, too, often possess magnetic properties, as, for example, those of Giant's Causeway and of Compass Hill in Cannay Island, Hebrides.

*) Dr. Otto Hahn imagined he had found in meteorites traces of many organisms representing the fauna and flora of cosmical bodies existing "wissnichtwo." When someone succeeded in creating similar bodies in the laboratory by means of infernal boilings, Dr. Hahn's theory was supposed to have been effectually refuted.

*) Laplace's theory of the lunar origin of meteorites, which is admitted to be valid on mathematical grounds, is improbable on biological ones, for the absence of atmosphere and water, and the great oscillations of temperature at the present time render improbable the theory of the existence of organic life even in the simplest forms. We do not know enough about past conditions to be able to speculate profitably concerning them.

One of the difficulties in the way of the theory of terrestrial origin of meteorites lies in the presence in them of certain substances (phosphorus, nickel-iron, sulphides) which could not exist in an environment which included air and water.*

*) 'An introduction to the Study of Meteorites.' British Museum (Natural History), Ed. 10. 1908, p. 33.

In the hottest part of a volcano there would be a process of dissociation taking place, so that compounds would be resolved into elements, some of which would again enter into combination when a lower temperature permitted it.

If products of dissociation were present in the interior of masses which were being hurled into space with terrific force and velocity, then before air or water could effect a change, the masses would be out of range and go on for ever unchanged until they collided with other bodies or entered an atmosphere. Sir Robert Ball inclines to the belief that the meteorites were projected from the earth in past ages, and the discovery of the nummulitic nature of these bodies confirms that belief. If these views are correct, the date of ejection must, of course, have been later than the period of metamorphosis of the fragment of changed limestone which constituted the particular aerolite.

***

If the plutonic rocks and such metamorphic rocks as the gneisses are all of them metamorphosed limestones, then it becomes difficult to draw any line of distinction between the two classes. Indeed, this difficulty seems to have been an old standing one in geology. I have seen for instance, a specimen from Argyllshire showing granite intruded into gneiss. The nummulitic disks are present in both portions, and can be seen easily in the gneiss, but only with difficulty in the granite. The granite was simply a part of a lower zone of much metamorphosed nummulitic limestone intruded into an upper zone of probably sedimentary changed nummulitic detritus (gneiss).

***

Although plutonic and volcanic rocks are arranged chronologically according to their position with regard to the various strata to which they are juxtaposed, here they are consigned provisionally to the one Era - the Eozoic - because not only is the fauna identical, but the calcareous remains of that fauna have become "silicated." In 'The Student's Lyell,' Ed. J. W. Judd, 1911, p. 521, it is written, "There is no reason for doubting, however, that, if we could penetrate many thousands of feet beneath the roots of such volcanoes as Vulcano and Vesuvius, we should find the rhyolites of the one graduating through quartz-felsites into granite, and the basalts of the other passing by easy transitions through dolerites into gabbro."

***

The metamorphosis of calcareous skeletons whereby they become silicated, silicified, or dolomitised is common throughout the ages. _Eozoön_ which must now be definitely accepted as a Foraminiferan, furnishes an excellent example both of change into various silicates and into dolomite. A common form of silicon compound in _Eozoön_ is the magnesium silicate with iron, known as olivine, this when hydrated becomes serpentine. The grains of the Cretaceous Greensands are very frequently casts of Foraminiferal shells in glauconite or hydrated silicate of iron alumina and potash.

The felspar and mica of granite are double silicates of alumina and potash. In the case of granite, the Foraminiferan is a massive colonial form, but the Greensand Foraminifera are minute separate shells, and, further, they have not been subjected to heat and pressure. Again, the originally pure carbonate of lime skeletons of the dolomites have become changed into calcium and magnesium carbonate.

The prevailing conditions at various periods have been very different. Sir R. Murchison ('Siluria,' Ed. 4., 1867, p. 489) writes: "I could here cite the works of many eminent writers for numerous evidences of the grander intensity of causation in former epochs...."

When the oceans were formed, the pounding down of the heated waters on to the perhaps scarcely formed crust must have led to their being super-saturated with certain minerals.

In the excellent handbook, 'The Science of the Sea' (prepared by the Challenger Society, and edited by G. H. Fowler), Dittmar's analysis of sea water is given. It is stated that there are only 0'432 part by weight of calcium in 1,000 parts y weight of sea water, yet marine organisms with calcareous skeletons have to extract all the necessary lime out of that sea water. Silicon is not even mentioned, probably owning to it being present in such infinitesimal quantities. It must be there, otherwise how could Diatoms which have formed oozes covering an area of ten million square miles, also Radiolaria, and Sponges, make their skeletons?

The above-mentioned facts point to the probability that one of the sources of the minerals present in metamorphosed limestones is the sea.*

*) Recently I have found several important formations to be composed of sandy or sanded nummulites, the detritus of limestone rocks. The shells are modelled in fine particles of sand from which all, or nearly all, calcareous matter has gone. Sand of this nature may have been one of the sources of the silicon of the compounds of double silicates with silica found in igneous rocks.

***

Light is thrown on the problem of the composition of the earth's crust by the marvellous results of stellar spectroscopy. Sir Norman Lockyer ('Inorganic Evolution,' p. 169) shows that calcium, silicium and magnesium exist in the hottest stars. He points out that the gaseous elements and the non-gaseous elements first formed, together with sodium and the above-named three elements, would tend to be the chief chemical substances on and over the surface of the planet. With regard to organic evolution he writes: "The most easily thinkable organic evolution under these circumstances would be that of organisms built up of these chemical forms, chiefly because they would represent the more mobile or the more plastic materials;" I once heard Sir Norman Lockyer remark that elements like calcium, silicium and magnesium "had lost their chance." I understood him to mean that they had early become stereotyped into elements of relatively low atomic weight unable to undergo further "inorganic evolution" into more highly evolved "elements" with more complicated spectra. However, the time came when the relative lightness of certain compounds of the first two elements enabled them to become suitable scaffolding material for protoplasm.

***

Certain observations of Darwin on the shape of air-cells in banded trachytes are of interest from the point of view of the theory of nummulitic structure of those rocks. He writes ('Geological Observations,' p. 78): "That some cause does produce parallel zones of less tension in volcanic rocks during their consolidation we must admit in the case of the small flattened crenulated air-cells in laminated rocks of Acension." Darwin attributed the existence of zones of low tension to the stretching resulting from the movement of a slowly moving semi-solid mass. He compared the flow of the molten trachyte to that of a glacier, but Forbes' viscous theory of glaciers is no longer accepted. Darwin refers to a banded trachyte described by Scrope (Geol. Trans., 1827 (2), 2. p. 195, Pl. 24, fig. 2) which has burst upwards through an overlying mass of rock. Here I would point out with deference that it does not seem obvious why under such circumstances zones of low tension should arise from stretching. Harker ('A History of the Igneous Rocks') states that generally cooling magmas contract, and that in crystallization the net result is contraction. The banding of trachytes appears to me to result from cooling of an acid magma giving rise to vacuum planes in which small crystals form. The streaking of air-cells and the arrangement of felspar crystals lengthways would result from the flow movement. According to Darwin's theory the low-tension zones arise from stretching in the direction of flow, and the gases distributed through the mass become arranged in those zones. According to the theory of shrinkage due to cooling the magma in place of cooling like a homogeneous mass of iron contracts in visible zones, and thereby gives rise to vacuum-laminae. A "flow" of banded trachyte might be compared to a segment of a huge onion stone. In a large mass of this rock over four feet square, which I brought back from Porto Santo Island, I can often see four or five very fine bands passing through one nummulite shell. Lines of least resistance are present also in basic lavas, but are not visible (see p. 32).

When a piece of banded trachyte is broken with a hammer, it fractures along the plane of the dark bands and reveals a layer of nummulite shells. The flattened crenulated air-cells probably owe their peculiar character to the fact of their being included within hollow flattened coiled nummulite shells or _débris_ of the same. The shells can be made out in the white felspar bands wherever crystallization has not gone too far, as well as in the dark zones. I find to my surprise that it is possible to make out some structural details of the shells in thin sections of rock. Very thick sections, however, would probably show the Foraminiferal structure better.

The discovery of the true nature of the igneous rocks will throw light on the formation of land elevations and ocean depressions.

It seems improbable that volcanic islands are mere sporadic heaps of metamorphoased limestone. It is, I think, more likely that this rock is distributed over vast areas of the ocean floors under surface layers of the various oozes (see Chapter 11.).

***

It seems not unreasonable to assume that the shifting of huge masses of rock from the interior to form great heaps on the surface must give rise to unstable conditions of the crust.

Changed nummulitic limestones support the rest of the crust of the globe, and when large quantities of it are ejected, great hollows will be formed. It is not surprising that earthquakes are common at Messina and Catania, and in Calabria. Mighty Etna, covering a base of 100 square miles and rising 12,000 feet, must have left huge subterranean gaps. Even over mines made by human hands, houses and streets fall in, as at Droitwich for example.

One day when the earth's crust has become more stable, it will perhaps be possible to travel in these huge altered-limestone caverns "measureless to man."*

*) The intrepid voyagers in Jules Verne's romance, 'A Journey to the Centre of the Earth,' started down a jokul in Iceland. After a wonderful journey, but before reaching their destination, they were hurled up on a raft borne on a column of hot water through the crater of Stromboli, much to the disgust and disappointment of the old German professor who had planned the trip.

## 5. Petrological Considerations.

The fact of having discovered a new and fundamentally important feature in the construction of igneous rocks, will, I trust, justify me in submitting a few remarks on the Stromatoporoid theory from the petrological point of view.

I believe that in time to come, no student of petrology will omit to inform himself as to the structure of nummulites. It is not a matter of the first importance from the point of view of the present theory, whether a rock is acid, intermediate, basic or ultrabasic, or whether it is abyssal, hypabyssal or superficial. In the numerous igneous rocks of all varieties that I have examined I have found them to be disguised (? colonial) Foraminifera. Petrologists will, I am certain, appreciate the value of this discovery, for it will often aid them in understanding the construction of the masses of minerals with which they have to deal. The crystals of the silicon compounds, of which igneous rocks are mainly composed, are "allotriomorphic," _i.e._, their form is moulded by their surroundings. Obviously it will be important to understand the real nature of these surroundings. Firstly, there is the general "stromatic" arrangement of the mass as a whole, and secondly, the individual disks have each a central umbilicus (through which, apparently, a common bud-bearing stolon passed), a coiled series of segments, and - a by no means unimportant feature - rows of pores. I often see a relatively large formless plug, or a crystal in the umbilicus, and little crystals in the segments of the coiled Foraminiferal disks of igneous rocks, and a banded structure may be apparent not only in the gneisses but also in granites. Probably the retention of considerable traces of Stromatoporoid structure in Plutonic rocks is due to the fact that owing to compression in a confined space there is but little tendency to displacement of individual portions of the whole mass. In volcanic rocks such as viscous lavas the Foraminiferal structure is not effaced, because the temperature has not been sufficient to reduce the semi-solid mass to a liquid state.

***

When a petrologist, with the kindest intentions, shows me a section of a dolerite in which the mineral olivine is breaking down into serpentine, and apparently giving rise to structure regarded by believers in the organic theory as Foraminiferal, and asserts that the existence of such phenomena is fatal to that theory, I can only fall back on my common-sense. These petrological facts are very interesting in their place, but of no value whatever as evidence against the nummulitic theory. For I see clearly and abundantly the Formainiferal structure in many different kinds of igneous rocks. The nummulitic theory will be found to be thoroughly satisfactory, and the more so, the more it is looked into, and I believe it has only to be examined by competent men of science to be accepted by them. I have been told that I am making too much fuss about these insignificant Stromatoporoids about which no one knows or cares anything at all. Well, I believe that the discovery of the true nature of these organisms will prove to be of value in more than one science. The foundations of the world are built of nummulites which are probably Stromatoporoids.

***

Recently a petrologist concluded that a piece of rock we were both looking at was a sandstone. I at once denied that statement. The specimen was sectionised and found to be a finely-grained basalt. I had seen the disks and knew the rock was a piece of metamorphosed nummulitic limestone. I feel justified in relating this, to show what a useful and ready diagnostic instrument will presently be available for petrologists.

***

The new theory appears to lead to the conclusion that one of the factors of magmatic differentiation consists in the removal of certain elements from one part of a Stromatoporoid scaffolding or mass of shells to another. Possibly the basalts and trachytes of Porto Santo were approximately similar in character before the outbreak of volcanic activities. The differences now existing may be due to the upper strata of silicated nummulites having been poured out suddenly, while the remaining layers became subject to more prolonged igneous action, thereby losing by fluxion their alkaline constituents. Perhaps the well-known "Agua de Porto Santo" owes its alkaline character to the presence of salts that had once formed part of what is now a highly acid trachyte.

Where trachytes are above basalts in the volcano, the condition might be due to fluxed elements sinking down into the lower strata and being retained there.

***

A petrologist tells me that the proofs of the mineral origin of _Eozoön_ are now much more convincing than formerly, but so are the proofs of organic origin. One is reminded of the competition between armour and projectiles or safe-makers and burglars. The nummulitic disk, however, is doubtless going to settle the question at last.

## 6. Biological Considerations.

Stromatoporoids and nummulites in general are probably for the most part shallow-water organisms (see p. 40).

Sir John Murray estimates that if the land were cast into the sea and all reduced to a uniform level, an ocean 1450 fathoms deep would cover the globe. It does not follow from this that the floor of the ocean could not be formed of rocks composed of benthos organisms that had lived in relatively shallow water. As I mentioned above, it seems improbable that volcanic islands represent mere _sporadic_ heaps of metamorphosed nummulites. It is, I think, more likely that they are local upheavals of a widely spread formation underlying the oozes which carpet the ocean floor. The depressions resulting from the assumed sinking of the shallow water formation would be complementary to the land elevations caused by the upheaval of that formation.

Wherever there are igneous rocks (plutonic and volcanic) and certain metamorphic rocks, there are nummulitic formations, _i.e._ portions of ancient sea-floors.

During the Eozoic Era, the plant might - if a little poetic licence can be allowed, and not much is asked for - almost be regarded as a gigantic Rhizopod encrusting a foreign body. A varied fauna and flora, mainly pelagic, must have existed contemporaneously, just as in the case of a great reef at the present day. These pelagic organisms probably led to a precarious existence evading the hungry pseudopods of the Dawn Animal. Possibly the lowest Metazoa (Zoophytes, Corals, Medusae, _etc._) owe the possession of those curious organs of offence and defence - the thread-cells - to a process of natural selection which led to the survival of the organisms which could best escape the deadly zone of pseudopods of the all-pervading _Eozoön_.*

The Parazoa (Sponges) retained to a greater or less extent the microphagic way of feeding. They began a free life, but soon settled down and failed to travel far along the path of evolution. The Metazoa, on the other hand, developed a gastric cavity whereby the cells co-operated and poured out secretions which digested the food. The highly fed and free swimming Metazoa developed organs which responded to light, sound, _etc._

Although _Eozoön_ represented the dominant type during the Eozoic Era, yet, from the point of view of the higher life, Destiny had done with the Dawn Animal. A stationary organism enclosed in a shell and provided only with mere prolongations of sarcode (pseudopods) was not endowed with organs which could help it to rise in the scale of being. The first essential for such an ascent was the development of a motile apparatus enabling the organism to move about as a whole, and accordingly the pseudopods were replaced by flagella. From the higher Protozoa were evolved two great groups, the Parazoa and Metazoa.

***

The neighbourhood of volcanic and coral islands appears to furnish interesting archaic types of fauna.

Several of the recent Pharetron sponges, and some species of Lingula are found in the vicinity of these islands.

That strange anachronism, the sponge-alga, _Merlia normani_, which is identical in structure with some of the Silurian Monticuliporoids,* is found off Porto Santo Island, and has probably existed there since Palaeozoic times. It could hardly have migrated from elsewhere, for Siliceous sponge larvae only exist in the free swimming state for a few hours. It seems probable that this remarkable organism will be found off all the volcanic islands in the temperate zones of the Atlantic.

## 7. On Dolomitic Limestones.

It may at first sight be difficult to understand what connection can exist between _Eozoön_ and dolotmites, but I have found there is a close relationship, and that _Eozoön canadense_ has given the clue to the real nature and origin of the Permian dolomitic limestones.

Tyrol is the fairyland of the Alps, and a glorious country to spend a vacation in. From the summits of its cimas and campaniles one looks down sheer precipices thousands of feet deep, and on every side are pinnacles of most weird and fantastic shape.

The mountains are made of pure magnesian limestone, and very frequently no fossils are to be seen in them. I believe the most accepted theory is that the rocks are coral reefs, but that all, or nearly all, traces of coral structure have disappeared during the process of dolomitisation, _i.e._, the conversion of the original pure calcium carbonate into carbonate of lime and magnesia.

I have made the strange discovery that the Austrian Dolomites and the Permian dolomitic limestones of England are purely Foraminiferal, and made up of nummulites which may be colonial. I have seen the nummulitic disks in numerous examples of these rocks. Further, a layered arrangement is frequently discernible.

The substance of the rock has become so fused and amalgamated probably partly by solution before dolomitisation, and by pressure, that it is not always easy, especially in the highly crystalline rocks, to see the disks with their central umbilicus and radial and concentric pattern, but they are there, and can frequently be made out without much difficulty by means of a lens.

In the case of some dolomitic rocks, other fossils than the nummulites are present. The Foraminifera did not have the sea all to themselves, other organisms died, and sank down to the Formainiferal reefs and became covered up. I have seen the disk structure best in a specimen of pure dolomite from Ledrotal, Tyrol, one of several examples procured for me from abroad.

This discovery of the origin of the dolomitic limestones is an especially fortunate one at the present moment. For perhaps suspicion will arise that there may be, after all, some truth in the statement that granites, basalts and lavas are likewise composed of nummulite disks. Then again, the fact that dolomites form cliffs thousands of feet thick may enable us to realise that the primitive nummulites or Stromatoporoids might - and did - form nearly all round the globe, beds of very porous limestone of immense thickness, which became transformed into silicates. These, owing to their position became compressed on account of the shrinkage of the planet, heated, molten or semi-molten, and finally cooled and crystallized. In spite of all this the original "layering" and also the form of the disks can often be clearly detected; of that I am quite certain.

## 8. On Oolitic Limestones.

The Jurassic Oolitic Limestones have a structure resembling petrified fish-roe (oon lithos stone egg). The usually spheroidal grains vary considerably in size in different oolites.

A careful study of the actual shell shows at least four spiral coils wound round the funnel-shaped umbilicus. The large primary chamber is a little to the right and above the pore-like upper opening of the umbilicus. Each of the larger dark spots is probably a large pore; double rows of very minute dots in Fig. 2 are smaller pores. The obscure radial lines are fractures in the neighbourhood of septa. The large irregular light patch to the right of the centre shows a broken area. "Willow pattern" obscurely visible along broken edge in Figs. 2, 3. (See Fig. 15.)

In the centre is seen a defined oval area (3 by 2 millimetres) with a faintly shaded spot in the centre of the oval. The oval area is the wide lower orifice of the funnel-shaped umbilicus, and the faint spot is the minute aperture at the upper end of the same.

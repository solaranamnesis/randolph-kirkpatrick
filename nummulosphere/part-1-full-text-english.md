## Introduction

The discovery of the original organic nature of the igneous rocks was led up to by finding that _Eozoon_ was a Stromatoporoid,* _i.e._ a colonial nummulite. Accordingly it is essential to give a brief preliminary account of _Eozoön canadense_ (see Chapter 1.).

*) Στρῶμα layer, πὁρος pore, Stromatoporoids being formed of organically connected _layers_ of nummulites, each shell having a _central perforation_, the umbilicus. The name was given to certain Palaeozoic fossils having a "layered" structure and peculiar pores on the surface. Many theories have been put forward to explain the nature of these layers and pores.

The mere mention of the name of the Dawn Animal seems not infrequently to excite violent igneous action, a phenomenon which should not be evoked unnecessarily. With a sense of the responsibility incurred, I do not hesitate to declare that now there is convincing evidence as to the real nature of that organism around which so much controversy has raged. The modern scientific world is almost unanimous in its belief that _Eozoön_* is of purely mineral origin. In a memoir on the "Azoic System," two writers refer* to the "extraordinary delusion which has prevailed among palaeontologists with reference to the organic nature of _Eozoön_." Such delusions, in the case of those possessed by them, are charitably assumed to be supplemented by the desire to do something sensational. The _coup de grâce_ is supposed to be given to the organic theory because certain writers seem to have carried their conclusions to absurd lengths. Dr. Otto Hahn, who wrote about the organisms found in meteorites and on the vegetable nature of _Eozoön_, comes in for special mention. But, as Herbert Spencer observed ('First Principles,' _ed._ 1884, p. 568), when he was being baited by hostile critics, there is an essential difference "between intrinsic absurdity and extrinsic absurdity."*

*) _Eozoön_ is a word of four syllables.

*) I have found Dr. Hahn's writings very interesting. He was nearer the truth than were his critics. He regarded _Eozoön_, granite, meteorites, _etc._, as mainly composed of plants. The branching canals of _Eozoön_ are consigned to several genera of algae. Dr. Hahn did not allow for the changes produced by mineralisation. The oogonia of "Chilocarpon" shown on Pl. 10. of "Die Urzelle" are probably young nummulite buds, the supposed cell-nuclei being pores or septal apertures. The umbilicus is shown in each bud.

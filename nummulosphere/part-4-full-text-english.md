#### Introduction

Fourteen years have passed since the publication of Part 3 of the Nummulosphere studies, but the scientific world has entirely ignored the work to its own real and serious loss. That this seemingly ungracious statement is simply true will presently become obvious when it is realized what a vast amount of untenable speculation concerning the nature and origin of the earth's crust has cumbered the literature; and, further, that more progress might have been made in the right direction. Occasionally Nature, in her irony, imposes on babes the task of adding to the wisdom of the wise, and when this happens it would be well for the wise to take heed of the message.

I have been regarded by certain official and academic orthodox authorities as a presumptuous person, a lunatic, a sensation-monger — epithets that I accepted _tout en bon gré_* — for venturing to publish my views on subjects apparently outside my special work, a branch of oceanic biology.

*) Words used by the adorable Joan of Arc when giving evidence before her judges.

The humour of the situation may become apparent even to themselves, when such authorities realize — as they will now gladly do — that oceanic biology is at the very root of the problem of the origin of the earth's crust and of meteorites. The stone that the builders have persistently rejected will be seen to be the "headstone of the corner" of planetary architecture.

I would have much preferred waiting a few more years in order to bring out a complete work; but having reached a time of life when the shouldering of great enterprises is apt to prove unduly difficult and irksome, I have decided to divided up the burden and publish from time to time a series of short "fasciculi."*

*) A term used by Sir A. Geikie in a letter to me.

I think it not amiss to call attention to the financial aspect. Since its beginning, in 1908, this research has cost me much over £2,000, all paid out of a modest salary and pension, and certainly by a cheerful giver. I have been my own publisher.

Part 3, in addition to numerous text-figures, has 24 plates of photographs. Almost the only word of sympathy and encouragement from a professional source was from Sir Archibald Geikie. Acknowledging the receipt of Part 3 he writes, "I admire the constancy and devotion with which you maintain your ideas."

A story is told of a man who, for a wager, stood on London Bridge and offered for sale at a penny a piece a tray of golden soverigns. He sold none, and lost his bet.

The coinage I offer — nummulites* — bears the image and superscription of Neptune — not Pluto — and will be found current in the realm of truth.

*) _Nummulus_, a small coin; _ite_, suffix.

I have been splendidly helped in my work. Mr. James Whitehead and his manager of works, Mr. W. W. Clark, have been especially helpful in supplying thinned slabs of rocks, often beautiful examples of craftsmanship.

Dr. V. E. Pullin, Director of the Research Laboratory at Woolwich, aided me with excellent skiagraphs of siderites and aerolites. The late Dr. Robert Knox, head of the Radio-Therapeutic Department at the Cancer Hospital, Fulham, took a great interest in my work, and enabled me to obtain a fine series of stereoscopic X-ray films. Mr. Heron-Allen and Mr. Earland have helped me considerably from time to time. Lastly I have had continual aid from my colleagues. Indeed, it is a source of satisfaction to me that I may have the good fortune to bring credit to that great institution the British Museum — to me ever a beloved and beneficent Alma Mater.

##### Igneous Rocks

I published my first pamphlet on this subject in 1913, rashly coming into the heated arena with a drawn sword — "An account of _so-called_ igneous rocks," and with a picture of Neptune defiantly holding aloft on his trident a lump of igneous rock. Still worse, theateningly he holds in his other hand a meteorite.

Jove, Neptune and Pluto, the sons of Saturn, settled by lot their respective spheres, but strangely it fell to _my_ lot to discover that Jove and Pluto had meanly defrauded their brother. For the so-called Plutonic rocks are all from Neptune's domain, and even the thunderbolt, the supposed appanage of High Jove, is really the property of Neptune. Hence my determination to restore Neptune to his just and legal rights. The igneous rocks may still be "so-called," but the term plutonic is a highly illogical, misleading piece of nomenclature, and I, for one, refuse to accept and use the same, even if I continue to be _contra mundum_.

"But to my task."

Thanks chiefly to the Imperial Marble Works I have a unique collection of granites, large slabs 18 inches by 12 inches and only 1/16 inch thick, polished both sides, and smaller bits 1/50 inch thick and quite transparent.

Further, I have a very large collection of X-ray stereoscopic skiagraphs of granites each 12 inches by 10 inches for the Wheatstone reflecting stereoscope, and 6 inches by 3 inches for the direct vision instruments.

Also I have very numerous photographs taken both by reflected and transmitted light, some photos covering an area of six square feet — the natural size of huge blocks of granite in quarries. All these objects convey much instruction and leave not a particle of doubt as to the organic nature of igneous rocks. But happily, the wonderful new truth can be learned by men, women and children without all this prodigious preparation. For you have only got to observe _very patiently_ and _carefully_ the polished slabs of granite so abundantly prevalent in every town, gradually and inevitably to become aware of a strange fact. Your eye and brain will presently discern and recognize obscure shapes amidst the dominating pattern of the rock minerals. To escape this pattern it is well to stand off some distance and dodge the reflexions. Just as observers in aeroplanes see areas of ancient sites invisible to those on the ground, so the ancient fossils of the rocks will show better at a little distance.

#### Introduction

Fourteen years have passed since the publication of Part 3 of the Nummulosphere studies, but the scientific world has entirely ignored the work to its own real and serious loss. That this seemingly ungracious statement is simply true will presently become obvious when it is realized what a vast amount of untenable speculation concerning the nature and origin of the earth's crust has cumbered the literature; and, further, that more progress might have been made in the right direction. Occasionally Nature, in her irony, imposes on babes the task of adding to the wisdom of the wise, and when this happens it would be well for the wise to take heed of the message.

I have been regarded by certain official and academic orthodox authorities as a presumptuous person, a lunatic, a sensation-monger — epithets that I accepted _tout en bon gré_* — for venturing to publish my views on subjects apparently outside my special work, a branch of oceanic biology.

*) Words used by the adorable Joan of Arc when giving evidence before her judges.

The humour of the situation may become apparent even to themselves, when such authorities realize — as they will now gladly do — that oceanic biology is at the very root of the problem of the origin of the earth's crust and of meteorites. The stone that the builders have persistently rejected will be seen to be the "headstone of the corner" of planetary architecture.

I would have much preferred waiting a few more years in order to bring out a complete work; but having reached a time of life when the shouldering of great enterprises is apt to prove unduly difficult and irksome, I have decided to divided up the burden and publish from time to time a series of short "fasciculi."*

*) A term used by Sir A. Geikie in a letter to me.

I think it not amiss to call attention to the financial aspect. Since its beginning, in 1908, this research has cost me much over £2,000, all paid out of a modest salary and pension, and certainly by a cheerful giver. I have been my own publisher.

Part 3, in addition to numerous text-figures, has 24 plates of photographs. Almost the only word of sympathy and encouragement from a professional source was from Sir Archibald Geikie. Acknowledging the receipt of Part 3 he writes, "I admire the constancy and devotion with which you maintain your ideas."

A story is told of a man who, for a wager, stood on London Bridge and offered for sale at a penny a piece a tray of golden soverigns. He sold none, and lost his bet.

The coinage I offer — nummulites* — bears the image and superscription of Neptune — not Pluto — and will be found current in the realm of truth.

*) _Nummulus_, a small coin; _ite_, suffix.

I have been splendidly helped in my work. Mr. James Whitehead and his manager of works, Mr. W. W. Clark, have been especially helpful in supplying thinned slabs of rocks, often beautiful examples of craftsmanship.

Dr. V. E. Pullin, Director of the Research Laboratory at Woolwich, aided me with excellent skiagraphs of siderites and aerolites. The late Dr. Robert Knox, head of the Radio-Therapeutic Department at the Cancer Hospital, Fulham, took a great interest in my work, and enabled me to obtain a fine series of stereoscopic X-ray films. Mr. Heron-Allen and Mr. Earland have helped me considerably from time to time. Lastly I have had continual aid from my colleagues. Indeed, it is a source of satisfaction to me that I may have the good fortune to bring credit to that great institution the British Museum — to me ever a beloved and beneficent Alma Mater.

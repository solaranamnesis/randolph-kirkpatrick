#### Introduction

Fourteen years have passed since the publication of Part 3 of the Nummulosphere studies, but the scientific world has entirely ignored the work to its own real and serious loss. That this seemingly ungracious statement is simply true will presently become obvious when it is realized what a vast amount of untenable speculation concerning the nature and origin of the earth's crust has cumbered the literature; and, further, that more progress might have been made in the right direction. Occasionally Nature, in her irony, imposes on babes the task of adding to the wisdom of the wise, and when this happens it would be well for the wise to take heed of the message.

I have been regarded by certain official and academic orthodox authorities as a presumptuous person, a lunatic, a sensation-monger — epithets that I accepted _tout en bon gré_* — for venturing to publish my views on subjects apparently outside my special work, a branch of oceanic biology.

The humour of the situation may become apparent even to themselves, when such authorities realize — as they will now gladly do — that oceanic biology is at the very root of the problem of the origin of the earth's crust and of meteorites. The stone that the builders have persistently rejected will be seen to be the "headstone of the corner" of planetary architecture.

I would have much preferred waiting a few more years in order to bring out a complete work; but having reached a time of life when the shouldering of great enterprises is apt to prove unduly difficult and irksome, I have decided to divided up the burden and publish from time to time a series of short "fasciculi."*

*) A term used by Sir A. Geikie in a letter to me.

I think it not amiss to call attention to the financial aspect. Since its beginning, in 1908, this research has cost me much over £2,000, all paid out of a modest salary and pension, and certainly by a cheerful giver. I have been my own publisher.

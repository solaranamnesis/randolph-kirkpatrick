#### Introduction

"What is wanted is, in fact, the skilled eye guided by a brain. _Hence the need of a long and patient training of the sense of sight_, attentive and reasoning observation of the phenomena to which it is directed, perfect sincerity, the entire abandonment of preconceived ideas, all united to a passionate love for science and truth." "A Day in the Moon," by the Abbé Th. Moreux, Director of the Bourges Observatory. [Transl.]

The foundations on which the stately edifice of modern geological science is supported are to a certain extent unsound, though easily to be made secure.

A discovery, and one, too, of a very simple nature, has recently been made, which will inevitably bring about a revolution in our ideas concerning the nature and origin of by far the greater part of the planetary crust, and will modify our conceptions even of cosmic evolution. The discovery referred to is that of the organic origin of igneous rocks and meteorites.

Huxley was fond of saying there seemed to be no limit to the possibilities of Nature, but at the present time to many men of science it seems inconceivable that white-hot volcanic lava, a lump of granite or a stony or iron meteorite could have originated in any degree from the action of living matter. Yet, as a result of many thousands of extremely careful observations, I am wholly certain that these bodies — at least, all which I have examined — primarily owe their existence to the agency of life, and moreover afford evidence of that agency, exactly as a mass of fossil shells or fossil skeletons of any sort bear witness to the former existence of the living organisms that made them. Only, in the case of the igneous rocks and meteorites, the fossil skeletons, owing to their peculiar shape and structure (see Chap. 8), have lost their individual outlines, and have become completely mineralized and, in some cases, ore-enriched.

The significance of the newly found facts will best be shown by means of a brief survey of certain matters of geological history.

##### Neptune _versus_ Pluto

In many parts of the world,* a traveller journeying from the coast or the plains, preferably along the course of a river, to some great range of mountains, will probably first meet with mud-flats, sands and gravels. On reaching the hills and outer zone of the mountain-massif, the rocks will perhaps be found arranged in more or less horizontal layers of shales, sandstones, conglomerates, limestones, etc., all of them evidently being hardened sediments or precipitates which, had formerly been laid down in water. The rocks forming the core of the mountain chain will be in steeply inclined layers of dense, finely-crystalline texture or in coarsely-crystalline unstratified masses. Lastly, active or extinct volcanoes, the sources of congealed rivers of once-molten rock, may be met with; and rocks resembling the volcanic will be seen as dykes or layers (sills) among the sedimentary rocks. Obviously the softer and looser sediments on the plains would be more recent than the more compact strata of sedimentary rocks higher up, the latter, again, being less ancient than the very dense crystalline rocks which they partly overlap on the flanks of the mountains.

*) See Appendix, Note F.

Werner (1749-1817), the renowned professor of mineralogy at the mining school of Freiberg in Saxony, classed the rocks of the earth's crust under four groups, viz., the primitive (granite, gneiss, schists, basalt, etc.); the secondary, or mainly sedimentary (shales, sandstones, limestones, "newer basalt," etc.); the recent, or relatively recent, diluvial deposits (clays, sands, gravels, etc.); and the volcanic. He taught that a universal ocean once covered the globe, even above the highest mountain-tops. The crystalline primitive rocks were _chemically_ precipitated from the waters, just as salt or alum might be thrown down from their saturated solutions. Granite, which frequently forms the core of great mountain chains, was supposed to constitute the primitive and universal foundation of the globe.

The waters of the ocean receded, either by evaporation or by being whisked off by some comet or other heavenly body, or possibly by disappearing into an excavation* in the globe. All the primitive layers being in place, the sedimentary strata now became deposited, mainly by _mechanical_ but partly by chemical means, in the agitated waters.* Volcanic eruptions were merely superficial recent and local phenomena due to combustion of deposits of coal or bitumen, the lava being a water-formed rock altered by heat.

*) Behälter, a reservoir.

*) For simplification, no mention is made above of "transition" rocks between primitive and secondary or Floetz.

So far, then, according to the opinion prevailing at that time, the earth's crust owed its origin solely to the agency of water, from which it had been chemically and mechanically precipitated.

A totally different view had been slowly maturing, however, and presently began to make its influence felt.

Thirty years before the rise of the Wernerian doctrines, the great French investigator Guettard discovered the extinct volcanoes of Central France. In 1752, in the course of a journey in the Auvergne district, he noticed the mile-stones were made of a black stone which, from its resemblance to samples of rock from Vesuvius, he recognized as volcanic. Proceeding on his way he found even the villages were built of this stone, and presently discovered the cones, craters and lava-flows of long-extinct volcanoes. Evidently the now peaceful countryside had once been the scene of great volcanic eruptions.

The curious black columnar rock called "Basalt" — the name given to it by Pliny — was known to exist in various parts of Europe, at Giants' Causeway, and Fingal's Cave. Sometimes the rock forms the flat summit of a hill, and sometimes is sandwiched between layers of sedimentary rock. What was the origin of this mysterious black vitreous or very finely crystalline columnar rock, so different from the shales, sandstones and limestones? Certainly basalt had some resemblance to lava, yet apparently there were no traces of volcanic action where basalt was found, especially no remains of cones or craters. Lava was porous and full of cavities, and basalt homogeneous; and, further, lava was supposed not to be columnar. Guettard looked upon basalt as an aqueous rock that had been deposited from water by crystallization, and even twenty years after his discovery of the extinct volcanoes he defended this view. Geikie* comments on the whimsical circumstance of one and the same man being the parent of two diametrically opposed schools — the Neptunists and Vulcanists.

*) "The Founders of Geology," Sir A. Geikie.

In 1763 Desmarest visited Auvergne, and discovered unmistakable lava-flows showing distinct columnar structure. He realized at once that he had found the answer to the riddle of the origin of basalt, viz., that the rock was volcanic. He unravelled with wonderful skill the complicated tangle of phenomena displayed before him. In the most recent eruptions the lava-streams were still connected with the craters whence they had flowed, and scoriae remained. In the case of older lava-flows the cones and ashes had all been washed away, and the lava cut into by deep valleys. Lava which, perhaps, had once flowed down into some ancient valley now capped high hills or plateaux. Lastly, the oldest lava was buried beneath piles of sedimentary strata.

Desmarest traced all these great changes to the ceaseless operation of the agencies of denudation. It was now easy to account for the isolated masses and patches of basalt found in localities whence all other traces of volcanic action had disappeared.

In spite of Desmarest's splendid work a fierce controversy arose concerning the origin of basalt, the upholders of the theory of aqueous origin being termed Neptunists and the believers in the volcanic origin Vulcanists. The visits of some of Werner's most distinguished disciples, for instance von Buch and d'Aubuisson, to Auvergne, and the perplexities that assailed them, recall the story of Balaam. They came, perhaps, to curse, but went away bestowing approval on the Vulcanists.

So far as basalt was concerned, the views of the Neptunists gradually became discredited; but a still greater defeat was in store for them.*

*) In this general review of the Neptunist and Plutonist controversy, prominence is given rather to the period of prevalence of certain views than to the precise date of their origin.

Werner ignored the existence of great subterranean forces. The mountains were simply huge heaps of matter deposited _in situ_ from the ocean.

James Hutton (1726-1797), whom Geikie calls the "Father of Modern Geology," arrived at conclusions wholly different from the Wernerian. The folding, crumpling and uplifting of strata, which in some cases must necessarily* at one time have been horizontal, filled his mind with the idea of great upheaving forces. 

*) For how could highly-inclined strata composed of water-worn pebbles have been deposited in nearly vertical sheets?

He clearly perceived the contest between the upheaving and the more obvious wearing-down agencies. Water was one of the tools which cut valleys in the uplifted masses and ultimately ground down the latter wholly into gravel, sand and mud. The sediments became hardened into rocks by heat and pressure, and again upheaved. He regarded granite and basalt as materials emanating from the molten interior of the earth. Great was his delight when he discovered in Glen Tilt veins from a mass of red granite penetrating the black schist and the limestone, thereby proving the granite had once been molten and that it was not "primitive" in its relation to the other rocks.* Not only, then, was basalt related to volcanic lava, but even granite was formerly a molten rock of a similar nature, the coarsely crystalline texture being due to slow cooling under great pressure.

*) Hutton, "Theory of the Earth," vol. 3. p. 13.

Huttonians were termed "Plutonists" and were regarded by Neptunists as a more extreme section of Vulcanists. Gradually the Plutonists, now including Vulcanists, prevailed, and granite basalt and their like universally came to be termed "Igneous Rocks."

Neptunists became almost extinct, a few isolated cases being regarded as "eccentric."

Now comes a strange event in the history of natural science,* viz., the discovery beyond the faintest shadow of doubt that the Neptunian theory is right after all. The so-called igneous rocks are of aqueous origin. They are marine formations, so far as I have observed, and fossiliferous throughout.

*) Attempts have been made to prove on petrological grounds the purely aqueous origin of igneous rocks. I would especially call attention to "Essai sur la genèse et l'évolution des roches," 1912, by A. Vialay. I doubt if this learned treatise would ever have any effect against the Plutonian stronghold. The proof, however, that igneous rocks are fossiliferous is unanswerable, unless indeed we are to assume the existence of a Plutonic fauna living in an "inflamèd sea" with shores of "burning marl" (Milton, "Paradise Lost").

During the summer of 1912, in the hope of solving a problem presented by a remarkable sponge, I was led to investigate certain fossils called Stromatoporoids and Eozoon (see Chapters 3 and 10).

After a prolonged controversy Eozoon had been finally accepted by the scientific world as a mineral of purely mineral origin. Dr. Carpenter, however, had regarded it as a gigantic reef-forming Foraminiferan.

One day I found in one of Dr. Carpenter's sections something which I took to be a small coiled nummulite shell situated in one of the supposed chambers of the Eozoon. I concluded Dr. Carpenter was right in his theory of organic origin.

At this stage I went on a dredging expedition to Porto Santo Island, and in spare time examined the volcanic rocks. To my amazement I found in them traces of Foraminiferal shells. At Madeira, also, the igneous rocks revealed similar structures. On returning to London, I examined in the Natural History Museum volcanic rocks from all parts of the world, and in every instance detected the shells. Lastly, I found similar objects in granite and other Plutonic rocks, in meteorites and in abyssal oozes. I published a small book entitled "The Nummulosphere: An account of the organic origin of so-called Igneous Rocks and of Abyssal Red Clays," with two plates of photographs of the supposed shells. The book was, I believe, regarded by some as a symptom of mental derangement on the part of the author. I have no cause for complaint, for my startling statements were not supported by sufficient evidence, and I had only a partial glimpse of a great truth.

I found Stromatoporoids and Receptaculites, which are universally regarded as the remains of definite and distinct organisms, to be formed of nummulites, and concluded the latter were associated in colonies. These fossils are palaeontologically similar to igneous rocks, and hence I regarded the latter as masses of nummulite colonies resembling coral-reefs. When I made the surprising discovery that the above-named fossils were pseudomorphs made of masses of ordinary nummulite shells, the colony-theory of igneous rocks likewise fell to the ground. All alike are simply masses and lumps of nummulitic rock. Continuing the study of rocks, I discovered in sections of Eozoon and igneous rocks objects which I took to be Radiolaria and Diatoms. Here, apparently, was a source of part of the silica which forms so great a proportion of the planetary crust. Again I published a pamphlet on the genesis of the igneous rocks.

I now turned my attention to the nummulite shells which I had seen with the aid of a hand-lens in igneous rocks, many limestones, abyssal red clays and meteorites. I found the shells belonged to the genus _Nummulites_.

At the same time I discovered a singular mistake on my part. All the objects which I had taken to be skeletons of Radiolaria Diatoms and coccoliths in igneous rocks I found to be portions of nummulite shells. The peculiar nummulitic spiral-disk structures (Chapter 8), as seen in rock-sections under high powers, closely resemble plankton skeletons. After a great expenditure of time and trouble, I had collected into four octavo plates thirty-eight photos of supposed plankton skeletons in igneous rocks. Some of the pictures are very deceptive and "convincing." Space can now only be spared for a few of the smaller ones (Plate 2C). Other observers likewise have been deceived by these nummulitic structures in chalk, Eozoon, &c.*

*) The supposed Precambrian Radiolaria figured by Cayeux (Bull. Soc. Geol. France, 22, plate 11. 1899), are, I believe, nummulitic structures. Ehrenberg ("Mikrogeologie," plate 30. B) describes parts of nummulites in the chalk of Rugen as crystalloids or morpholiths. Sorby (Ann. Mag. N. H., 1861, 8. p. 193) confuses Ehrenberg's crystalloids with coccoliths. Hahn ("Die Urzelle") makes several genera of algae and a worm out of the discoid and funnel-like parts of the pillars of the same Foraminiferan. The "spheres" of chalk have been mistaken for Radiolaria, Foraminifera, &c. (Mem. Geol. Survey, 1903, "Cretaceous," 2. p. 501). 

In spite of very careful search, I am at present unable to produce indubitable evidence of the existence of a single plankton skeleton in igneous rocks. Why, then, do I entitle this book "Benthoplankton"?* This name is chosen because the circumstantial evidence is strongly in favour of the theory that a portion of the silica of igneous rocks comes from the skeletons of organisms, and especially of plankton organisms. See Chapters 1 and 2 on "The Ocean" and "Chalk." The soluble silica of the skeletons had dissolved, and had silicified and silicated the nummulite shells amongst or above which they had fallen.

*) Benthos — organisms living at the bottom; plankton — those living at or below the surface of the water. A benthoplankton ooze or rock is one made of a mixture of benthos and plankton skeletons. Igneous rocks are here described as benthoplankton, even though no plankton skeletons persist, because the evidence is in favour of the theory that part of the silica of those rocks is derived from plankton organisms. Benthos, plankton, and benthoplankton are used either as adjectives or substantives.

Looking back over the history narrated above, it is now easy to detect the fatal flaw in the "Plutonic mail."*

*) Playfair's "Illustrations," p. 279. Adopting the analogy used by the illustrious Dr. Playfair, it may now be said with truth that the Neptunian scale-armour is absolutely impenetrable to the prongs of Plutonian pitchforks. 

When the fallacy of Werner's coal-combustion theory of volcanoes was detected,* lava came to be regarded as an "igneous" rock of deep origin and not as a heated superficial aqueous rock. One variety of the "igneous" theory — for there are several — is clearly stated by Whitney and Wadsworth in their memoir on the igneous rocks: "The original crust of the earth must have been azoic, if we adopt the views held by the large majority of geologists that our globe has cooled down from a former condition of igneous fluidity. The volcanic and eruptive rocks must necessarily be azoic _because they have come from the heated interior of the globe, reaching the surface in a melted condition_. We do not, however, designate the eruptive and volcanic rocks as "Azoic"; the fact that they are necessarily in this condition is assumed as something self-evident."* The Neptunian theory of the aqueous origin of basalt though correct was obviously a pure guess. Neptunists, for instance, defended with incredible obstinacy the view that basalt had been deposited from water in the place where it was found (Appendix, Note A). Plutonists, on the other hand, were right concerning the ascent of basalt as a molten magma; but their denial of the aqueous origin of the rock has, for over a hundred years, falsified scientific speculation concerning the real nature of the planetary crust (Appendix, Note P).

*) For it soon became impossible to escape seeing the identity of the Auvergne lava and basalt. In this district basalt lies on granite, below which no Wernerian could imagine coal to exist. Here, then, were volcanic rocks remote from burning coalfields.

Volcanoes and lava streams are heaps and masses of silicated nummulitic limestone, i.e., they are of aqueous and organic origin. All the rest of the igneous rocks are of a similar nature and origin. Seeing that these rocks and the sediments derived from them constitute the bulk of the planetary crust, it follows that the lithosphere is mainly composed of silicated nummulitic rock. It will be shown that the ocean floor is almost certainly formed of nummulitic deposits, even in areas covered with recent plankton dust.

Eocene nummulitic limestones thousands of feet thick extend across north-west Africa, Europe and Asia, from Morocco and Spain to Japan, forming the middle and upper parts of great mountain-chains. This "nummulitic epoch" is not an isolated event, for nearly the whole planetary crust is made of nummulitic rocks in the form of chalk and other limestones and igneous rocks. Rocks are sometimes classified as fossiliferous and unfossiliferous, but all are fossiliferous. Again, they are classed as igneous, sedimentary and precipitated; but igneous rocks _are_ precipitated, and sedimentary rocks are precipitated rocks ground down. Really, then, there is, broadly speaking, one rock, viz., benthoplankton.

The materials composing the vast bulk of the planetary crust may be classified as follows:

Marine Benthoplankton deposits  
│  
└───Submarine, (clay surface of ancient benthoplankton deposit plus recent benthoplankton)  
│  
└───Supramarine or land (hardened benthoplankton deposits)  
|...│  
|...└───Sediments of igneous rocks and limestones  
|...│  
|...└───Original deposits  
|.......│  
|.......└───Much altered (igneous rocks)  
|.......│  
|.......└───Not so much altered (marine limestones)

Remarks on the above table. — Marine benthoplankton deposits are mainly composed of the skeletons of unicellular organisms; in the case of non-igneous rocks, Corals Mollusca Brachiopoda Echinodermata and Algae contribute largely. Remains of fresh-water benthoplankton and of land faunas and floras are, relatively to the mass of the planetary crust, almost negligible; and, moreover, they are mixed up with sediments of marine benthoplankton. I have found nummulitic remains even in coal cinders, as well as in slates, sandstones, grits, muds, sands, etc., from many localities.

The planetary crust, so far as it is accessible to observation, is composed of mineralized organic remains, the bulk of these being silicated nummulite shells. The lithosphere is veritably a silicated nummulosphere.

My statements concerning the igneous rocks have not yet been accepted. Some even declare it is not necessary to search these rocks in quest of organic remains, the theory of organic origin being manifestly absurd.

An attitude of this kind is not surprising in view of the history of the Eozoon controversy; and countless observations have been made on rock-sections, without any trace of organic structure being detected. Yet how frequently evidences of some new truth have escaped notice till attention has been specially drawn to them!

At one time it was said no organic life could exist in the great abysses of the ocean. In these sunless depths there would be no plant life, on which animal life must, in the long run, subsist; and further, animals, even if they could exist, would have to be supported by enormous cuirasses to withstand the assumed high pressure. In fact, it was physically and biologically impossible for animals to live in great depths. Actual dredging in great depths soon dispelled all these fallacies by revealing a rich abyssal fauna. A slender zoophyte dredged from 2900 fathoms in the Central Pacific almost melted on deck before the eyes of its captors. So with the theory of the existence of organic remains in igneous rocks. _Solvitur spectando_.

I shall now briefly reply to certain criticisms and objections:—

1) That no traces of organic remains could survive in rocks that had once been molten.

Dr. J. F. Bottomley, of the Thermal Syndicate, Newcastle-on-Tyne, very kindly undertook, at my request, to melt a piece of Radiolarian earth in an electric furnace. At about 1700° C. the earth completely melted, forming when cooled a dark glassy bead. Sections of the latter show very distinct organic structures. Plate 2E, Fig. 21, shows nummulitic structure. The photo shows traces of nummulitic disk-structures.

With the kind help of Prof. W. H. Merrett and Mr. H. M. Chappie of the Royal School of Mines, pieces of the same earth were subjected to a temperature of 1600° C. in a Meker furnace. When the oxygen was turned on the earth became glowing white hot. Just at the melting point it was cooled down and sections were cut from the resulting slag. Radiolaria are so very clearly visible that it is possible to determine the species (Plate 11, Fig. 49). The temperature of lavas varies from 900° C. to 1500° C.* The melting point of silica is 1600° C., but that of silicates depends on the composition, the basic being more easily fusible than the acid — basalt, for example, being more tractable than trachyte or granite.

*) _Fide_ Prof. J. P. Iddings, "Lectures on Vulcanism," London, 1914.

2) That the supposed organic remains in igneous rocks may be of accidental origin.

The suggestion has been made that the skeletons said to be found by me in igneous rocks may be recent deposits or incrustations; or the rock when in a molten state may have licked up the organic remains.

If a plug of granite one hundred metres long and, say, one centimetre in area, were cut out of the De Lank granite quarry in any direction, and cut into sections 0.1 mm. thick (_i.e._, into one million sections), I am justified in stating that traces of organic remains would certainly be found in every section.

3) That the author has not had sufficient experience to justify him in publishing opinions on igneous rocks.

It has more than once been hinted to me, and in no unfriendly manner, that I am dealing with matters beyond my special province. There is indeed an appearance of this, but in reality, so far as main issues are concerned, I am on my own ground. Knowledge of the chemical composition and mineral characters of every rock on earth avail — I will not say nothing — but very little. What is needed is some knowledge of nummulites, and practice in examining these shells with the hand-lens and compound microscope.

Tow-netting and dredging in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean have familiarised me with the exceeding richness of oceanic life. During the last year and a half I have travelled over England and Wales from Sunderland to Land's End and from St. David's Head to the Norfolk coast, to examine igneous rocks and limestones _in situ_ and to collect material. With the help of colleagues I have obtained specimens and collections of minerals from many parts of the world.

Lastly and chiefly, as a result of innumerable microscopic observations, I have acquired a certain degree of specialised skill. The eye has been trained to appreciate delicate structure, and to trace the various stages of degradation and alteration in nummulite shells found in igneous and other rocks from the Eocene to the Laurentian.

The book is divided into four parts.

In Part 1 evidence is brought together showing the strong _a priori_ reasons for believing in a theory of organic origin of igneous rocks. It is pointed out that an origin of this kind is such as might well be expected to result from the operation of the laws of nature.

A chapter on the ocean is followed by one on a typical benthoplankton rock, viz., chalk. Next follows a chapter on a more changed rock of a similar nature, viz., Eozoon, and, again, one on those still more changed benthoplankton structures commonly known as igneous rocks and meteorites. In Part 2 is given a description of the genus _Nummulites_, followed by an account of the occurrence of nummulites in igneous rocks, meteorites, etc. Part 3 refers briefly to certain speculations on the origin of life.

Part 4 contains a description of certain pseudomorphs commonly known as _Stromatoporoids_, _Receptaculitidae_, _Archaeocyathus_, _Girvanella_, _Loftusia_, etc.

I am deeply indebted to my colleagues in the Geological, Mineralogical, and Bibliographical Departments of the Natural History Museum for much kind help. Further, I have been granted many privileges by the Museum authorities, especially in being permitted to study valuable type collections of fossils, meteorites, etc.

I take this opportunity of expressing my grateful acknowledgments to Mr. L. M. Lambe, Mr. R. A. Johnston, and Mr. A. T. McKinnon, officers of the Geological Survey of Canada, who sent me at my request a magnificent set of minerals collected at Côte St. Pierre, Quebec, the classical Eozoon-ground, and transported with much difficulty to Montreal for shipment. One royal example of "Eozoon canadense" weighs over a sixth of a ton.

The friendly sympathy of some who have followed my work has been a valuable aid. Geschworner G. Henriksen of Minde, Bergen, especially has endeavoured to call the attention of scientific men to the new discovery.

I have been fortunate in securing the services of Mr. P. Highley. I think no one has had more experience in drawing from the microscope. He was making drawings of Eozoon for Dr. Carpenter forty years ago. Thanks are due also to Messrs. Raines, of Ealing, who have taken great pains to secure good photographic results, and to Mr. Butterworth for careful cliché work.

Also I would gratefully refer here to the very patient and skilful work of Messrs. William Clowes and Sons.

NOTE. Anything of scientific value in "Nummulosphere" Parts 1 and 2 is incorporated in Part 3. The first two parts, which are no longer of use, have been of the nature of stepping-stones that have helped me, in spite of much initial error, to arrive at the truths explained in the present work.

_Postscript_. The irregularity in the numbering of the plates is due to the suppression of many of the earlier plates even after the latter had all been printed off.

The original title of Part 3 viz., "Sea-Floors or Benthoplankton" (see page-headings) has been changed to "The Ocean Floor or Benthoplankton." The designation "Nummulosphere" refers to the fact that one of the concentric planetary layers (viz. the earth's "crust") is almost wholly composed of mineralized nummulites, the other zones being atmosphere, hydrosphere and centrosphere.

#### Chapter 1

##### The Ocean

"Ocean, the parent of all." — Iliad 14. 246.

The words of the poet are literally true. For both the emerged land area and the submerged oceanic area of the planetary crust are almost wholly products of the ocean, and born of its substance, and life is the chief agency that has brought about this result.

In the course of a long sea-voyage, the traveller in some swift, high-decked ship, though he may frequently see dim forms of fish or medusae swimming in the depths, and also flying fish, porpoises, and other marine creatures, yet is apt to get an impression of boundless areas devoid of life.

To him, and even to naturalists acquainted with the wonderful richness of oceanic life, the idea of the birth of the earth's crust from "the unapparent deep"* may well seem chimerical. Nevertheless the facts relating to the surface-life of the ocean, and to the nature of the ocean-floor and of igneous rocks, all point to the oceanic and mainly organic origin of the planetary crust.

*) Smooth tropical seas in moderate depths often seem almost as transparent as air or crystal. In Milton's grand line, "The birth of nature from the unapparent deep," the deep is the void of space.

##### The Surface of the Ocean

If, with the aid of a water-telescope to banish reflections, we look down through the clear waters off some tropical island of the East Indies, say Java,* we may see on the sea-bottom great masses of coral, gigantic Tridacnas and huge Neptune's-Cup Sponges. All these massive constructions began life as minute soft specks of living substance, which, in the course of their growth, extracted from the sea the carbonate of lime and silica of their skeletons. It is not, however, these large organisms that we must regard as world-builders, but, rather, certain kinds of minute shells. The white sand on the floor of the submarine garden will be found to be very rich in small calcareous shells of Foraminifera. In tropical latitudes, Foraminifera sometimes form reefs and banks obstructing navigation. The boring into the Funafuti coral-atoll revealed the fact that the reef was to a considerable extent built of Foraminifera.

*) "Where seas of glass with gay reflections smile  
Round the green coasts of Java's palmy isle."

— "The Botanic Garden," Erasmus Darwin.

*) "The Age of the Earth." "Funafuti: the Study of a Coral-Atoll." W J. Sollas.

Nummulitic limestones many thousands of feet thick and chalk one thousand feet thick are exceedingly rich in these shells. Further, if igneous rocks are examined with sufficient care they also will be found to be built chiefly of Foraminifera in which the carbonate of lime has become replaced by silicates.

For one of the sources of the silica that forms such a large proportion of the earth's crust we must look elsewhere than to the floor of the sea.

Prof. W. K. Brooks in his memoir on "The Genus Salpa," when referring to the food of that pelagic Tunicate, describes the mid-ocean surface as "a living broth." This apt comparison may serve to convey some idea of the abounding life existing in and near the ocean surface. The living creatures are very small and mostly of microscopic size. Prof. Brooks gives some striking examples of the almost incredible abundance of marine life: "Salpae are often found swarming at the surface of the ocean in numbers beyond description." "The smaller species are often so abundant that for hundreds of miles any bucketful of water dipped up at random will be found to contain hundreds of them. _The food of Salpa consists of Radiolarians, Diatoms_, and other micro-organisms which float in the water. The supply of this food is unlimited." 

G. Chierchia ("Viag. _Vettor Pisani_," p. 31) writes of the Atlantic: "The zone of equatorial calms is beyond measure rich in life. Sometimes the water looks as if it is coagulated, and this condition is apparent also to the touch." Concerning Copepods, G. S. Brady writes ("_Challenger_ Narrative" 1. 2. p. 843): "The sea from the Equator to the Poles supports such vast numbers of them, that it is often coloured by wide bands for many miles." They may be compared with the herbivora on land, for their food consists of Diatoms. Further, Brady says the Copepods are an important item of food for whales in Arctic seas. Accordingly these minute "sea locusts" form a link between the smallest plants and the largest animals. 

Haeckel ("_Challenger_ Radiolaria") states: "Radiolaria occur in all seas of the world." "The development of Radiolaria in large masses is very remarkable, and in many parts of the ocean is so great that they play an important part in the economy of marine life." 

In a classical passage, Sir Joseph Hooker ("Flora Antarctica" 1. 2. p. 505) writes: "The universal existence of such an invisible vegetation as that of the Antarctic Ocean is a truly wonderful fact, and the more from its not being accompanied by plants of a high order. During the years we spent there, I had been accustomed to regard the phenomena of life as differing totally from what obtains throughout all other latitudes; for everything living appeared to be of animal origin. The ocean swarmed with _Mollusca_, and particularly entomostracous _Crustacea_, small whales and porpoises: the sea abounded with penguins and seals, and the air with birds: the animal kingdom was ever present, the larger creatures preying on the smaller, and these again on smaller still: all seemed carnivorous. The herbivorous were not recognised, because feeding on a microscopic herbage of whose true nature I had formed an erroneous impression. It is, therefore, with no little satisfaction that I now class the _Diatomaceae_ with plants, probably maintaining in the South Polar Ocean that balance between the animal and vegetable kingdoms, which prevails over the surface of our globe.... The end these plants serve in the great scheme of nature is apparent, on inspecting the stomachs of many sea-animals."

To add a final quotation, Murray and Renard ("Deep-Sea Deposits, _Challenger_" p. 281) write: "These siliceous Algae are met with everywhere in the surface and sub-surface waters of the ocean. At times they occur near the surface in enormous numbers, in great floating banks many miles in extent and several fathoms in depth." "It is ... impossible to drag a very fine tow-net through the sea-water anywhere without capturing ... these minute organisms." 

Beyond the littoral zone the ocean appeared to be tenanted solely by animals which lived by preying on each other. On land the animal-world subsists in the long run on plant-life. Hooker found that this law holds in the ocean, but the individual plants are mostly invisible. The ocean is covered with floating prairies amid which browse the Protozoa, Copepods, Salpas, etc., these in turn forming the food of marine carnivores. Since plant-life other than Bacteria and Fungi depends on sunlight, the ocean vegetation cannot live below the limit reached by the sun's rays and must necessarily be a floating flora. 

Prof. V. H. Blackman ("Science of the Sea," p. 116) classes the oceanic phyto-plankton into six groups of which only one secretes silica, viz. the Diatoms. These microscopic algae are found all over the ocean, but more abundantly in waters of relatively low salinity (Castracane, "_Challenger_ Diatomaceae"). Though the group is universal, yet many genera and species are restricted to certain areas. Castracane regards temperature as the chief barrier which prevents a cosmopolitan distribution of species.

Whether devoured or not, the siliceous frustules of Diatoms sink to the bottom, and in some areas, especially in the Southern Ocean, form a characteristic Diatomaceous ooze. Sometimes the frustules appear to get dissolved, for Murray and Renard ("Deep-Sea Deposits," p. 283) state: "It seems difficult to account for the absence of Diatom remains in some deposits, except on the supposition of removal by exposure to the action of sea-water."

It has been proved, especially by the researches of Hinde, Sollas, and Zittel, that the flint and chert of Chalk and other limestone formations is derived mainly from the skeletons of organisms. I think it is very probable that much of the silica of those hardened and crystallized Foraminiferal deposits known as igneous rocks is likewise of organic origin.

Diatoms* and one-celled plants may be compared to the base of a great pyramid of oceanic life, and there is reason to suppose this relation has held good almost from the beginning of geological time.

*) Deby regards some Diatoms as pluricellular.

The Diatoms themselves have persisted as simple cells undergoing division, the halves remaining physiologically independent. As Brooks points out, these simple algae have led an easy existence immersed in a nutrient fluid bathed in sunshine, whereas effort is the price of advance up the evolutionary scale.

These minute siliceous algae have probably existed from near the time when the ocean was born and the sun began to shine on it perhaps millions of centuries ago. The actual frustules have not yet been found among igneous rocks, but the circumstantial evidence that the silica and silicates of those organic deposits is partly derived from Diatoms and Radiolaria is very strong.

The proportion of soluble silica in sea-water is extremely small according to Murray and Irvine* one part in 200,000 to 500,000. These authors concluded that Diatoms obtained their silica from suspended clay. E. J. Allen's experiments on Diatom-culture,* apparently showing the necessity for the presence of certain vitamines in the seawater, reveal the complicated nature of the problem of metabolism in Diatoms.

*) Journ. Mar. Biol. Assoc. Plymouth, 10. p. 417, 1914. 

There are certain other algae that indirectly aid in the extraction of silica from the sea, viz. the zooxanthellae or "yellow cells" found in many Radiolaria. The symbiosis between the algae and their Radiolarian ally has been shown by experiment to be so effective, that the combination can be self-sufficing, the Radiolarian being able to live without capturing food.

The Diatom mud of the Antarctic forms a nutritious food for fishes and other animals. Probably the Diatoms from the surface formed part of the food supply of the nummulites that constitute the mass of the igneous rocks, the Foraminifera afterwards becoming silicated by material derived from the frustules.

The Diatoms and zooxanthellae depend on sunshine. Accordingly, I was led to modify Linnaeus' designation of the rocks as "daughters of time" and to call them "daughters of the sun."*

Summary 

At the present day oceanic life depends on the simple plant vegetation at the surface, and especially on the Diatoms, and there is every reason to believe this relation has held good almost from the beginning of geological time i.e. the beginning of the formation of the earth's crust.

The surface life of the ocean has been an important source of the silica which forms a great part of the lithosphere. The planetary crust is mainly a product* of the evolution of life.

*) From a philosophical point of view, the earth's crust might be described as a by-product of the evolutionary process, psychic development being the aim.

##### The Floor of the Ocean

Until recent times the floor of the ocean beyond a few hundred fathoms was a region of profound mystery, and consequently men of science were in complete ignorance concerning the greater part of the surface of the planetary crust. During the last sixty years, however, human ingenuity has succeeded in surveying and charting the ocean floor almost as completely and surely as if it had been laid bare to ordinary observation.

The merit of this great achievement belongs especially to the _Challenger_ Expedition (1873-76), though great credit is due to other enterprises undertaken before and since that epoch-making voyage. As a result of these explorations it is now possible to picture to the mind the submerged mountains, valleys and plains of the ocean, the weird inhabitants of the abysses and the nature of the bottom. It is this last feature that is a matter of present concern.

Sir John Murray* estimates the area of the surface of the globe at 197 millions of square miles, of which dry land occupies 54 millions and the ocean 143 millions. The ocean floor is covered with muds, "oozes" and clay. Murray classes these deposits under two groups, viz. the Terrigenous, fringing the great land areas, and the Pelagic remote from land. The terrigenous deposits (littoral muds sands and gravels, coral sand and mud, volcanic sand and mud, greensand, and green red and blue muds) covering an area of 28.6 millions of square miles are more or less composed of materials derived from land.

*) Scottish Geogr. Mag., 4. p. 1, 1888, and 6. p. 265, 1890. 

The pelagic deposits, formed either of Red Clay or of skeletons of plankton organisms,* cover an area of 114.6 millions of square miles, and are distributed as follows:—

— | Mean depth in fathoms | Area in millions sq. miles | Distribution  
Globigerina Ooze | 2000 | 49.5 | Atlantic chiefly, Indian Ocean, and Pacific  
Diatomaceous Ooze* | 1477 | 10.9 | Southern Ocean chiefly  
Radiolarian Ooze | 2894 | 2.3 | Indian Ocean and Pacific  
Pteropod Ooze | 1044 | 0.4 | South Atlantic  
Red Clay | 2730 | 51.5 | Eastern Pacific chiefly, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean  

*) Nummulites are abundantly present in Globigerina and Diatom-oozes. In Nummulosphere 1 I unnecessarily suggested adding the designation "palaeonummulitic" to the names in use. The nummulites in the above oozes are probably derived from subaerial and submarine eruptions. In depths greater than 2700 fms. calcareous plankton dust is dissolved, and the clayey surface of the probably universal nummulitic deposit is left bare.

*) See Appendix, Note L.

The results of the _Challenger_ dredgings so far as concerned the first three deposits in the above list did not come as a surprise, for scientific men were already familiar with Globigerina- and Diatomaceous oozes and with fossil "oceanic" deposits of Radiolaria; but the "capital discovery" — to use Huxley's expression — that at a mean depth of 2730 fathoms and over an area of 51.5 millions of square miles there existed a deposit of red clay, was something wholly new and unexpected. At first the clay was thought to be the finest detritus of the land, but this hypothesis was soon found to be untenable.

A remarkable feature about the deposit was the almost entire absence of shells of pelagic Foraminifera, which were abundant in neighbouring areas of less depth, and which flourished at the surface of the ocean above the Red Clay. The absence of the shells was attributed to their being dissolved in the course of their very slow descent in the greatest depths.*

*) Dittmar considered sea-water to be the chief dissolving agency of calcareous skeletons, the carbonic acid being apparently already held up. Murray believed carbonic acid derived from decomposing organic matter inside the shells to be an additional dissolving agency ("_Challenger_ Narrative," 1. p. 981). Possibly, too, carbonic acid, however formed, would gravitate slowly to the deepest troughs; but if so, the amount is not sufficient to prevent or to destroy life.

Sir Wyville Thomson* came to the conclusion that Red Clay was the residue or ash of the calcareous organisms left after the removal of the carbonate of lime. When samples of Globigerina ooze were carefully washed and treated with weak acid, after the carbonate of lime had been removed there remained a small residue of reddish mud composed of silicate of alumina. Huxley, who accepted provisionally Wyville Thomson's theory, writes:* "So long as the Globigerinae collected at the surface have not been demonstrated to contain the elements of clay, the _Challenger_ hypothesis, as I may term it, must be accepted with reserve and provisionally, but, at present, I cannot but think that it is more probable than any other suggestion that has been made. Accepting it provisionally, we arrive at the remarkable result that all the chief known constituents of the crust of the earth may have formed part of living bodies; that they may be the "ash" of protoplasm, ...." Wyville Thomson's theory was incorrect, the fallacy in it having arisen owing to the omission to wash the samples of Globigerina ooze with _sufficient_ care before dissolving them in acid. There is no clay residue to be got from clean pelagic shells gathered from the surface. The residue from shells lying on the bottom is simply that which has permeated them from the surrounding clay. Murray ("Deep-Sea Deposits," footnote p. 190) states that Wyville Thomson himself gave up the idea that the calcareous shells contained silicate of alumina.

*) "On some of the Results of the Expedition of H.M.S. _Challenger_," 1875.

Huxley's supposition concerning the organic origin of all the rocks — in the absence of the definite data now available — showed prescience and insight on the part of its author. He clearly saw how defective were the various theories concerning the nature of Red Clay, for he writes (l.c.): "I think it probable that we shall have to wait some time for a sufficient explanation of the origin of the abyssal red clay," and again, "It must be admitted that it is very difficult, at present, to frame any satisfactory explanation of the mode of origin of this singular deposit of red clay." Seemingly the answer to the riddle of the red clay has been found, and that answer helps to solve at the same time the problem of the planetary crust as a whole.

In 1877* Sir John Murray advocated the theory that the clay in pelagic deposits was a volcanic product derived from subaerial and to a lesser degree submarine eruptions. He and M. Renard adopted the volcanic theory in the report on "_Challenger_ Deep-Sea Deposits," M. Renard attributing a more important role to submarine eruptions.

*) "On the distribution of Volcanic _débris_ over the Floor of the Ocean." Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin. 9. p. 247 (1876).

In 1913 I examined the _Challenger_ deep-sea deposits and found that the samples of red clay were masses of compressed "nummulite" shells with sparsely scattered plankton skeletons embedded in them. Further investigation has shown that they belong to the genus _Nummulites_. It is possible to distinguish parts of the shells with a hand-lens, and under higher powers the nummulitic tubulated structure so characteristic of the genus (Fig. 1). These clay shells are present in all pelagic deposits, and also in abyssal terrigenous red and blue muds, but in red clay their presence is not masked by the calcareous plankton skeletons so abundant in some of the other pelagic oozes. Naturally it is difficult to find traces of nummulites in a ninety per cent. Globigerina ooze, but they can be detected in a half and half Globigerina ooze such as the one from Station 129 (South Atlantic, 2150 fathoms), where the carbonate of lime and silicates are in about equal proportions. Traces of clay shells, perhaps of volcanic origin, are present even in the nearly pure Radiolarian ooze from Station 225, 4475 fathoms, the deepest _Challenger_ sounding.

What, then, is the origin of the clay distributed over the ocean floor? I believe there are three sources, two of which, viz. subaerial and submarine volcanic eruptions, have already been indicated by Murray and Renard. Many of the great volcanoes border on the sea. During violent eruptions huge columns of dust and ashes are shot up miles high into the air, where they spread out over land and sea like a great pall blotting out the light for days together.* Air currents distribute the dust over vast areas, and on land, rivers carry down great masses of pumice to the sea, where they float for long periods till they sink water-logged to the depths.

*) During the eruption of Katmai in Alaska in June, 1912, darkness prevailed for sixty hours at Kodiak Island 100 miles away from the volcano, and the fumes reached Vancouver Island, 1500 miles away, the whole country for thousands of square miles being covered with a layer of volcanic dust about a foot thick. During the Krakatoa eruption the pall of darkness extended 276 miles away from the centre, and dust fell 1800 miles away. G. C. Martin, "The recent eruption of Katmai Volcano in Alaska." National Geographical Magazine, February, 1913.

Murray and Renard give many reasons for regarding submarine eruptions as a source of abyssal clay. It would be difficult on any other theory to account for the presence of vitreous lumps as large as walnuts in pelagic deposits remote from land. For these compact masses of volcanic glass could hardly have been transported either by air or water, but must have originated in the neighbourhood where they occur.

Mr. James Chumley of the "Challenger Office," Edinburgh, very kindly sent me at my request a typical piece of volcanic glass from Station 293, 2025 fathoms in the centre of the Western Pacific. The nearest land is the little speck of Easter Island 800 miles away. The precious fragment, about the size of a pea, is 7 x 5 x 5 millimetres in dimensions. A black glassy part is surrounded by brown bands of palagonite. Certainly the fragment has had an organic origin, for under the microscope it is not difficult to see indubitable and abundant evidences of nummulitic structure.

If — as Murray and Renard believe — this fragment has been ejected from a submarine volcano, it will afford evidence concerning the deeper parts of the ocean floor itself.

The presence of air- or water-borne products of land volcanoes on the floor of the ocean is of no special interest, but momentous conclusions must be drawn if material from some deep zone of the abyssal floor is found to be of organic origin. For we should learn that the Red Clay is not a mere superficial accumulation, but the surface layer of a deposit attaining a thickness of hundreds or thousands of feet — like the igneous rocks and nummulitic limestones on the land or emerged area of the planetary crust. Subaerial and submarine eruptions seem to me inadequate as sources of the whole of the oceanic clay. Murray and Renard record that "the sounding-tube sometimes penetrated to a depth of nearly two feet in the Red Clay."

Even if the deposit had only this small depth, it would be assuming a good deal to suppose that products of volcanic eruptions had been spread over an area of over 56 millions of square miles of ocean floor. The abyssal red clay areas are mostly remote from land, and probably very little air- or water-borne material would ever reach them. Even the finest land sediments would sink not very far from shore owing to the ionized condition of the seawater.* In my opinion Red Clay is partly the decomposed surface layer* of a vast formation of nummulitic so-called "igneous" rock thousands of feet thick.

*) Joly, "Radio-activity and Geology," p.123.

*)It is, however, of little importance for the present argument, whether the clay floor of the ocean is the decomposed original surface of the rock, like, for example, the surface of a Cornish moor, or whether that floor is made of formerly deep-seated erupted material of the same rock.

As stated above, human ingenuity has only succeeded in penetrating "nearly two feet" into the deposit. What are the grounds, then, for supposing that deposit to be thousands of feet thick?

New facts have recently come to light showing that the vast bulk* of the emerged or land area of the planetary crust is a deposit of nummulites. Certainly one third, and almost certainly the whole, of the oceanic area of the planetary crust is formed of a clay composed of silicated nummulites (admittedly derived in small part from land volcanoes). The difference between the emerged and submerged areas is simply one of position. Essentially and fundamentally they are identical, i.e. they are parts of a probably universal benthoplankton deposit of silicated nummulites.

*) I.e. igneous rocks and their sediments and most of the marine limestones.

Owing to the remarkable character of repetition on a continually increasing or diminishing scale, nummulitic structure has somewhat the same aspect under very low or very high powers. A very small area highly magnified may reveal a surprising amount of structure. Fig. 2 shows strands of curved marginal cord passing from side to side and "septa" of spirodisk from above downwards. Notice in central part of lower half of Fig. 2 a well-defined broad oval ring lying sideways. In the interior of the right end of the oval are six or seven very well-defined little disks in succession round the bend. Arches, bands and disks visible over the field.

[Plate 11: Figure 39](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure39.png) — Surface of a piece of chalk from Haling, 5x. There are portions of several nummulites visible in photo. The whole surface shows nothing but nummulitic structure, and every particle is in orderly arrangement, i.e. there is no débris. A marginal cord with septa curves round lower left corner within radius of 18 mm. Above middle of lower border are embracing gothic arches and a septum of shell in trans. section. (Lens 3x necessary for seeing details.)

[Plate 11: Figure 40](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure40.png) — Surface of flint, 8x. As in Fig. 39, but silicified. Nummulitic structure faintly visible over whole field. A marginal cord with septa curves upward obliquely in projection from left of centre of lower edge of photo to right of centre of upper edge.

[Plate 11: Figure 41](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure41.png) — _Eozoon canadense_, banded structure, 4x. Nummulitic structure is traceable both in light and dark bands, but with difficulty.

[Plate 11: Figure 42](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure42.png) — From section of Eozoon, and wrongly described in Nummulosphere Part 1 as a small nummulite shell. The dark gibbous area is really only a minute particle, 0.1 mm. in diameter, of a nummulite. The area shows disk structure especially along straight edge, and also septa astride of cord along upper left edge. 250x.

[Plate 11: Figure 43](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure43.png) — Rough surface of Cornish granite showing part of a marginal cord and embracing alar; also spirodisks single and in series. 4x. (Photo seen better reversed.)

[Plate 11: Figure 44](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure44.png) — Cornish granite. In upper left corner a septum in projection with "pans-pipe" rim, rising from banded cord; at lower left corner of photo part of another cord; disks fairly plentiful. 65x.

[Plate 11: Figure 45](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure45.png) — Cornish granite. A broad band of marginal cord extending across from S.E. to N.W. corner with two septa across and in projection; disks well shown. 110x. (Low-power lens should be used.)

[Plate 11: Figure 46](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure46.png) — Monte Somma bomb. Part of vitrified septum. For long a mystery to me, at first taken for Globigerina! Series of faint circles visible in projection round rim of large circle above. 110x.

[Plate 11: Figure 47](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure47.png) — Cornish granite. Good spirodisk in oblique projection in lower right corner. Lower of three radiating bands is probably the edge of a layer of spiral lamina. 110x.

[Plate 12: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate12-FigureA.png) — Section of Portland oolite, 3½x. Concentric beaded bands of marginal cord and radial alars and septa of nummulites faintly visible over the whole field, but seen best in right half of upper left quadrant. The granules follow to a considerable extent the lines of nummulitic structure. (Low power lens necessary.)

[Plate 12: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate12-FigureB.png) — Section of Schlern dolomite, 4x. Marginal cord and septa of a nummulite. Many hours of the closest scrutiny are necessary to trace the nummulitic structure in this apparently structureless confusion. (Owing to increased experience since Plate 12 was done, I would now have little difficulty in rendering obvious the nummulitic nature of dolomite.)

[Plate 12: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate12-FigureC.png) — Dresden syenite, 4x. Nummulitic structure rather muzzy and confused, but abundant. In lower third marginal cords passing down obliquely from left to right with septa across. Within centre of right edge of photo, 3 mm. below lower edge of C, a disk 3 mm. across and with cogged rim, also three little dotted circles to left of disk. A disk in oblique perspective, 6 mm. diam., with left lower rim blacked out, is visible 18 mm. above centre of picture.

[Plate 13: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate13-FigureA.png) — Section of Totternhoe Stone (Lower Chalk), 110x. A curved band of marginal cord with septa extends from side to side across middle of field. (Picture too dark, and not equal to negative. It has been difficult to get good results from photos of any of the chalks.)

[Plate 13: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate13-FigureB.png) — Section of Melbourn Rock (Middle Chalk) to show circular and oval "spheres," 65x. These "bodies" are simply clarified areas in nummulitic rock. The areas are usually discoidal, and not spheres either whole or in section. Nummulitic structure exists in the clear spaces, and can often be traced from light to dark areas. (See also Plate 23 Fig. H.)

[Plate 13: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate13-FigureC.png) — Weathered surface of a lump of _Eozoon canadense_, i.e. of a mass of very ancient nummulites. Natural size. The external form and inner structure of the nummulites in various aspects are visible to unaided eye, or under lens 3x. They are best seen in lower half of picture, where one or two might almost serve for descriptions of species.

[Plate 15: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate15-FigureA.png) — Section of Clee Hill diorite by transmitted light, 4x. Coils of marginal cord, with septa of a nummulite. Parallel lines of cord with bands across, and dishes between septa are visible with a lens.

[Plate 15: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate15-FigureB.png) — _Nummulites laevigata_ (from Selsey). Perpendicular section (ground down), 20x. Showing two marginal cords, also septa.

[Plate 15: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate15-FigureC.png) — Dresden syenite, 60x. Same view of a nummulite as in Fig. B.

[Plate 16: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate16-FigureA.png) — Stavropol meteorite. Section 5x, viewed by transmitted light.

[Plate 16: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate16-FigureB.png) — The same, 10x. (The central squarish black patch and two large white ones easily compare with the same in Fig. A.) Concentric — radial shell-structure and spirodiscoid structure fairly clear.

[Plate 16: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate16-FigureC.png) — A centre of a coil, 95x. (It is not certain whether this centre is that of a shell or of a spirodisk.) The furrowed band of marginal cord with coils winding at slightly different planes, with septa astride, and with smaller spirodisk structure is absolutely clear and indubitable after a little careful study with a lens.

[Plate 16: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate16-FigureD.png) — Centre of C, 1100x.

_Note_. — The Stavropol meteorite is a flat brick-shaped object about 5 by 4 inches in area and 2 inches thick. It was seen to fall on March 24 (o.s.), 1857, at 5 P.M. by a man working on a farm, and at a distance of about eighty yards, at Stavropol in the Caucasus. The specimen is in the Petrograd Museum. See H. Abich., Bull. Acad. Imp. Sci. St. Pétersbourg, tom. ii. 1860, p. 407. The photographs are those of a section made from a fragment in the British Museum (Nat. Hist.).

[Plate 17: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate17-FigureA.png) — Section of Snake River Basalt, 10x. Showing a slightly wider area than in Plate 14 A.

Careful study will show the ridged band of a "marginal cord" like a spirally wound motor-car tyre, with "septa" across. For guide to centre of coil see diagram.

[Plate 17: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate17-FigureB.png) — Mica 3½x. This wonderful photograph is crammed with details of nummulitic structure. The mica film was flaked off a thick block of dark amber-coloured Himalayan mica given to me by the great mica firm of Messrs. Wiggins. I have detected nummulitic structures even in the most transparent varieties of mineral by using the highest powers, but here the shell structure can be seen with a lens 3x. Spiral coils of marginal cord with septa and alars and spirodiscoid structures in all these are present over the whole field.

[Plate 18: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate18-FigureA.png)

[Plate 18: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate18-FigureB.png)

[Plate 19: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate19-FigureA.png) — Section of "Wold Cottage" meteorite, 4x. To left of middle of upper half of picture is a well-marked coil of marginal cord about two inches across and in slightly oblique perspective. Right half of coil shows (like a motor-car tyre) a curve from above down and also from side to side; parallel ridges well seen, also parts of septa across breadth, and spirodisks of which the whole shell is built. Within and nearly concentric with above coil is a smaller one near centre of the shell; and without and nearly concentric a much larger and less clearly denned marginal cord. The field where not too dark is crowded with nummulitic, including spirodisk structure (see, for instance, double band of disks crossing a marginal cord, just above centre of lower border of photograph).

[Plate 19: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate19-FigureB.png) — Section of Ensisheim meteorite, 4x. Nummulitic structure is abundant, but less clear than in the "Wold Cottage" meteorite.

[Plate 19: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate19-FigureC.png) — Dresden syenite. Section showing portions of broad band-like coils of marginal cord and also septa. 95x.

[Plate 20: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate20-FigureA.png) — Diatom ooze (_Challenger_, St. 157 Southern Ocean, 1950 fms.). Crushed fragment in balsam, 65x. It can be said with entire certainty that the six or seven circular, oval or (U-shaped bands are parts of septa or marginal cords of nummulite shells (and not Radiolaria). The structure is obscured by the numerous Diatoms. When the eye is trained, it becomes possible to detect abundant spirodiscoid structure throughout. 65x.

[Plate 20: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate20-FigureB.png) — Red Clay (_Challenger_, St. 165, 2600 fms.). Crushed fragment in balsam 260x. In lighter areas nummulitic structure is visible. (The poor results in this figure led to the making of the excellent sections, of which photos are shown in Place 21 Figs. C, D.)

[Plate 20: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate20-FigureC.png) — Section of a hard chalk from Missenden, 4x. The whole field is full of nummulitic structure, viz., spiral coils of cord and the septa, but it is very difficult to make out. When magnified 12 diameters the section shows Globigerina and "spheres."

[Plate 20: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate20-FigureD.png) — Small diamond from Transvaal, 4x. Showing nummulitic structure.

[Plate 20: Figure E](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate20-FigureE.png) — The same diamond 260x. Portions of marginal cord, septa, and spirodisks are visible to the trained eye, especially above centre of lower edge of picture.

[Plate 21: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate21-FigureA.png) — Section of rotten trachyte permeated with sulphur from interior of upper crater of Tenerife, 4½x. The coils of a much-blasted nummulite in perpendicular section are visible to the trained vision. The rock section has a pale reddish tinge, the red being much more apparent in sections.

[Plate 21: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate21-FigureB.png) — The same 450x. Every particle of the rock section shows nummulitic structure. The portion here selected shows part of a coil of marginal cord. The part figured was chosen to compare with Tschermak's figure of the section of Seres meteorite showing antler-like crystal with a wedge of olivine (biologically, part of marginal cord and septum). In addition there are septa and spirodiscoid structures.

[Plate 21: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate21-FigureC.png) — Section of Red Clay (_Challenger_, St. 165, 2600 fms.). Showing portion of a nummulite, 10x. Best viewed by making left border the lower. Curved series of circular disks seen across the field. Patient study with lens affords a wonderful revelation.

[Plate 21: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate21-FigureD.png) — The same 260x. Shows coiled disk-structure, i.e. miniature marginal cord and septa.

_Note_. — This plate is one of the most interesting of the set. The sections were made from red clay and rotten trachyte hardened in balsam. The trachyte would have become red clay if it had fallen into the ocean. Red Clay comes from one universal deposit of mineralized nummulites. The "clay" may have been erupted from a submarine deep-seated part of the deposit, or from a supra-marine or upheaved area of the deposit, or lastly from the disintegrated surface of the deposit _in situ_.

[Plate 22: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureA.png) — Section of Radiolarian Chert, 10x. The figure within white square is shown magnified in B.

[Plate 22: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureB.png) — One of the Radiolaria, 450x. Figs. A, B, are not needed here, and would have been deleted had it not been inconvenient to do so.

[Plate 22: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureC.png) — Polished surface of Mazapil meteorite, 5x. The fine dotted or granular markings distinct from lines of the section or from cracks are here and there arranged in circular groups or defined curved bands.

[Plate 22: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureD.png) — The same as C, but 175x. Photographed by reflected light. Here the organic and nummulitic structure is unmistakably apparent to the trained eye. (Use of lens 3x desirable.)

[Plate 22: Figure E](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureE.png) — Surface of Jamestown meteorite, 5x. Showing outlines of nummulitic structure, 5x.

[Plate 22: Figure F](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureF.png) — Section of chalk (Upper chalk, Haling). Showing nummulitic structure, 450x. It is very difficult to secure good definition partly owing to halation. Fig. F, though poor, will well repay study. The negative was the best of many attempts.

[Plate 23: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureA.png) — _Nummulites laevigata_. Vertical section. Inter-pillar area of spiral lamina, showing the tubulated-striated appearance, and faint traces of spirodiscoid structure. 260x.

[Plate 23: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureB.png) — _N. laevigata_. Section of a pillar showing faint traces of spirodiscoid structure in the supposed glassy structureless calcite. 1500x.

[Plate 23: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureC.png) — _N. laevigata_. Horizontal aspect of spiral lamina showing orifices of tubules. 260x.

[Plate 23: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureD.png) — As in C, but 1100x. Showing dotted granular structure and traces of spirodiscoid structure between tubules.

[Plate 23: Figure E](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureE.png) — Ehrenberg's granulated disklets from chalk, showing rings (the latter seen to be beaded under power of 350). 275x. Fig. E'. Other (smaller) examples of E, showing the beaded rings as solid disks (spirodisks). 2000x.

[Plate 23: Figure F](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureF.png) — "Morpholiths" such as shown in Fig. 5, p. 50; really a mass of spirodisks. 2500x.

[Plate 23: Figure G](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureG.png) — Two "canals" in Eozoon, showing granular serpentine to contain nummulitic structure continuous with similar fainter structure in the calcite. 450x.

[Plate 23: Figure H](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureH.png) — Melbourn Rock, showing "spheres" 450x. The edge of lowest sphere shows banded cord. Very careful study with lens 3x will reveal other coils and "septa," i.e. this "sphere" is a spirodisk.

_Note regarding Fig. "E," as marked on plate_. — E is the right half of the divided figure, and E' the left half (marked E on plate). See guide diagram.

[Plate 24: Figure H](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate24-FigureH.png) — Ganglion cells of grey matter of human brain. 1500x. The pictures are far too dark (and not so good as the negatives). The spirodisk structure is clearly visible in the preparations, for which I have to thank Dr. R. S. Trevor of the Pathological Laboratory, St. George's Hospital.

[Plate 24: Figure J](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate24-FigureJ.png) — Ganglion cells of grey matter of human brain. 1500x. The pictures are far too dark (and not so good as the negatives). The spirodisk structure is clearly visible in the preparations, for which I have to thank Dr. R. S. Trevor of the Pathological Laboratory, St. George's Hospital.

_Note_. — The above figures are best viewed under a strong light, and with a lens magnifying only 2 diameters (about 6-inch focus). 

If the pictures fail to convince — though C-G are fairly good — it is only necessary to examine, under oil immersion, any vegetable or animal cells or tissues to learn that the physical basis of life has a spirodiscoid structure.

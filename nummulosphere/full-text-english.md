#### Introduction

"What is wanted is, in fact, the skilled eye guided by a brain. _Hence the need of a long and patient training of the sense of sight_, attentive and reasoning observation of the phenomena to which it is directed, perfect sincerity, the entire abandonment of preconceived ideas, all united to a passionate love for science and truth." "A Day in the Moon," by the Abbé Th. Moreux, Director of the Bourges Observatory. [Transl.]

The foundations on which the stately edifice of modern geological science is supported are to a certain extent unsound, though easily to be made secure.

A discovery, and one, too, of a very simple nature, has recently been made, which will inevitably bring about a revolution in our ideas concerning the nature and origin of by far the greater part of the planetary crust, and will modify our conceptions even of cosmic evolution. The discovery referred to is that of the organic origin of igneous rocks and meteorites.

Huxley was fond of saying there seemed to be no limit to the possibilities of Nature, but at the present time to many men of science it seems inconceivable that white-hot volcanic lava, a lump of granite or a stony or iron meteorite could have originated in any degree from the action of living matter. Yet, as a result of many thousands of extremely careful observations, I am wholly certain that these bodies — at least, all which I have examined — primarily owe their existence to the agency of life, and moreover afford evidence of that agency, exactly as a mass of fossil shells or fossil skeletons of any sort bear witness to the former existence of the living organisms that made them. Only, in the case of the igneous rocks and meteorites, the fossil skeletons, owing to their peculiar shape and structure (see Chap. 8), have lost their individual outlines, and have become completely mineralized and, in some cases, ore-enriched.

The significance of the newly found facts will best be shown by means of a brief survey of certain matters of geological history.

Neptune _versus_ Pluto

In many parts of the world,* a traveller journeying from the coast or the plains, preferably along the course of a river, to some great range of mountains, will probably first meet with mud-flats, sands and gravels. On reaching the hills and outer zone of the mountain-massif, the rocks will perhaps be found arranged in more or less horizontal layers of shales, sandstones, conglomerates, limestones, etc., all of them evidently being hardened sediments or precipitates which, had formerly been laid down in water. The rocks forming the core of the mountain chain will be in steeply inclined layers of dense, finely-crystalline texture or in coarsely-crystalline unstratified masses. Lastly, active or extinct volcanoes, the sources of congealed rivers of once-molten rock, may be met with; and rocks resembling the volcanic will be seen as dykes or layers (sills) among the sedimentary rocks. Obviously the softer and looser sediments on the plains would be more recent than the more compact strata of sedimentary rocks higher up, the latter, again, being less ancient than the very dense crystalline rocks which they partly overlap on the flanks of the mountains.

*) See Appendix, Note F.

Werner (1749-1817), the renowned professor of mineralogy at the mining school of Freiberg in Saxony, classed the rocks of the earth's crust under four groups, viz., the primitive (granite, gneiss, schists, basalt, etc.); the secondary, or mainly sedimentary (shales, sandstones, limestones, "newer basalt," etc.); the recent, or relatively recent, diluvial deposits (clays, sands, gravels, etc.); and the volcanic. He taught that a universal ocean once covered the globe, even above the highest mountain-tops. The crystalline primitive rocks were _chemically_ precipitated from the waters, just as salt or alum might be thrown down from their saturated solutions. Granite, which frequently forms the core of great mountain chains, was supposed to constitute the primitive and universal foundation of the globe.

The waters of the ocean receded, either by evaporation or by being whisked off by some comet or other heavenly body, or possibly by disappearing into an excavation* in the globe. All the primitive layers being in place, the sedimentary strata now became deposited, mainly by _mechanical_ but partly by chemical means, in the agitated waters.* Volcanic eruptions were merely superficial recent and local phenomena due to combustion of deposits of coal or bitumen, the lava being a water-formed rock altered by heat.

*) Behälter, a reservoir.

*) For simplification, no mention is made above of "transition" rocks between primitive and secondary or Floetz.

So far, then, according to the opinion prevailing at that time, the earth's crust owed its origin solely to the agency of water, from which it had been chemically and mechanically precipitated.

A totally different view had been slowly maturing, however, and presently began to make its influence felt.

Thirty years before the rise of the Wernerian doctrines, the great French investigator Guettard discovered the extinct volcanoes of Central France. In 1752, in the course of a journey in the Auvergne district, he noticed the mile-stones were made of a black stone which, from its resemblance to samples of rock from Vesuvius, he recognized as volcanic. Proceeding on his way he found even the villages were built of this stone, and presently discovered the cones, craters and lava-flows of long-extinct volcanoes. Evidently the now peaceful countryside had once been the scene of great volcanic eruptions.

The curious black columnar rock called "Basalt" — the name given to it by Pliny — was known to exist in various parts of Europe, at Giants' Causeway, and Fingal's Cave. Sometimes the rock forms the flat summit of a hill, and sometimes is sandwiched between layers of sedimentary rock. What was the origin of this mysterious black vitreous or very finely crystalline columnar rock, so different from the shales, sandstones and limestones? Certainly basalt had some resemblance to lava, yet apparently there were no traces of volcanic action where basalt was found, especially no remains of cones or craters. Lava was porous and full of cavities, and basalt homogeneous; and, further, lava was supposed not to be columnar. Guettard looked upon basalt as an aqueous rock that had been deposited from water by crystallization, and even twenty years after his discovery of the extinct volcanoes he defended this view. Geikie* comments on the whimsical circumstance of one and the same man being the parent of two diametrically opposed schools — the Neptunists and Vulcanists.

*) "The Founders of Geology," Sir A. Geikie.

In 1763 Desmarest visited Auvergne, and discovered unmistakable lava-flows showing distinct columnar structure. He realized at once that he had found the answer to the riddle of the origin of basalt, viz., that the rock was volcanic. He unravelled with wonderful skill the complicated tangle of phenomena displayed before him. In the most recent eruptions the lava-streams were still connected with the craters whence they had flowed, and scoriae remained. In the case of older lava-flows the cones and ashes had all been washed away, and the lava cut into by deep valleys. Lava which, perhaps, had once flowed down into some ancient valley now capped high hills or plateaux. Lastly, the oldest lava was buried beneath piles of sedimentary strata.

Desmarest traced all these great changes to the ceaseless operation of the agencies of denudation. It was now easy to account for the isolated masses and patches of basalt found in localities whence all other traces of volcanic action had disappeared.

In spite of Desmarest's splendid work a fierce controversy arose concerning the origin of basalt, the upholders of the theory of aqueous origin being termed Neptunists and the believers in the volcanic origin Vulcanists. The visits of some of Werner's most distinguished disciples, for instance von Buch and d'Aubuisson, to Auvergne, and the perplexities that assailed them, recall the story of Balaam. They came, perhaps, to curse, but went away bestowing approval on the Vulcanists.

So far as basalt was concerned, the views of the Neptunists gradually became discredited; but a still greater defeat was in store for them.*

*) In this general review of the Neptunist and Plutonist controversy, prominence is given rather to the period of prevalence of certain views than to the precise date of their origin.

Werner ignored the existence of great subterranean forces. The mountains were simply huge heaps of matter deposited _in situ_ from the ocean.

James Hutton (1726-1797), whom Geikie calls the "Father of Modern Geology," arrived at conclusions wholly different from the Wernerian. The folding, crumpling and uplifting of strata, which in some cases must necessarily* at one time have been horizontal, filled his mind with the idea of great upheaving forces. 

*) For how could highly-inclined strata composed of water-worn pebbles have been deposited in nearly vertical sheets?

He clearly perceived the contest between the upheaving and the more obvious wearing-down agencies. Water was one of the tools which cut valleys in the uplifted masses and ultimately ground down the latter wholly into gravel, sand and mud. The sediments became hardened into rocks by heat and pressure, and again upheaved. He regarded granite and basalt as materials emanating from the molten interior of the earth. Great was his delight when he discovered in Glen Tilt veins from a mass of red granite penetrating the black schist and the limestone, thereby proving the granite had once been molten and that it was not "primitive" in its relation to the other rocks.* Not only, then, was basalt related to volcanic lava, but even granite was formerly a molten rock of a similar nature, the coarsely crystalline texture being due to slow cooling under great pressure.

*) Hutton, "Theory of the Earth," vol. 3. p. 13.

Huttonians were termed "Plutonists" and were regarded by Neptunists as a more extreme section of Vulcanists. Gradually the Plutonists, now including Vulcanists, prevailed, and granite basalt and their like universally came to be termed "Igneous Rocks."

Neptunists became almost extinct, a few isolated cases being regarded as "eccentric."

Now comes a strange event in the history of natural science,* viz., the discovery beyond the faintest shadow of doubt that the Neptunian theory is right after all. The so-called igneous rocks are of aqueous origin. They are marine formations, so far as I have observed, and fossiliferous throughout.

*) Attempts have been made to prove on petrological grounds the purely aqueous origin of igneous rocks. I would especially call attention to "Essai sur la genèse et l'évolution des roches," 1912, by A. Vialay. I doubt if this learned treatise would ever have any effect against the Plutonian stronghold. The proof, however, that igneous rocks are fossiliferous is unanswerable, unless indeed we are to assume the existence of a Plutonic fauna living in an "inflamèd sea" with shores of "burning marl" (Milton, "Paradise Lost").

During the summer of 1912, in the hope of solving a problem presented by a remarkable sponge, I was led to investigate certain fossils called Stromatoporoids and Eozoon (see Chapters 3 and 10).

After a prolonged controversy Eozoon had been finally accepted by the scientific world as a mineral of purely mineral origin. Dr. Carpenter, however, had regarded it as a gigantic reef-forming Foraminiferan.

One day I found in one of Dr. Carpenter's sections something which I took to be a small coiled nummulite shell situated in one of the supposed chambers of the Eozoon. I concluded Dr. Carpenter was right in his theory of organic origin.

At this stage I went on a dredging expedition to Porto Santo Island, and in spare time examined the volcanic rocks. To my amazement I found in them traces of Foraminiferal shells. At Madeira, also, the igneous rocks revealed similar structures. On returning to London, I examined in the Natural History Museum volcanic rocks from all parts of the world, and in every instance detected the shells. Lastly, I found similar objects in granite and other Plutonic rocks, in meteorites and in abyssal oozes. I published a small book entitled "The Nummulosphere: An account of the organic origin of so-called Igneous Rocks and of Abyssal Red Clays," with two plates of photographs of the supposed shells. The book was, I believe, regarded by some as a symptom of mental derangement on the part of the author. I have no cause for complaint, for my startling statements were not supported by sufficient evidence, and I had only a partial glimpse of a great truth.

I found Stromatoporoids and Receptaculites, which are universally regarded as the remains of definite and distinct organisms, to be formed of nummulites, and concluded the latter were associated in colonies. These fossils are palaeontologically similar to igneous rocks, and hence I regarded the latter as masses of nummulite colonies resembling coral-reefs. When I made the surprising discovery that the above-named fossils were pseudomorphs made of masses of ordinary nummulite shells, the colony-theory of igneous rocks likewise fell to the ground. All alike are simply masses and lumps of nummulitic rock. Continuing the study of rocks, I discovered in sections of Eozoon and igneous rocks objects which I took to be Radiolaria and Diatoms. Here, apparently, was a source of part of the silica which forms so great a proportion of the planetary crust. Again I published a pamphlet on the genesis of the igneous rocks.

I now turned my attention to the nummulite shells which I had seen with the aid of a hand-lens in igneous rocks, many limestones, abyssal red clays and meteorites. I found the shells belonged to the genus _Nummulites_.

At the same time I discovered a singular mistake on my part. All the objects which I had taken to be skeletons of Radiolaria Diatoms and coccoliths in igneous rocks I found to be portions of nummulite shells. The peculiar nummulitic spiral-disk structures (Chapter 8), as seen in rock-sections under high powers, closely resemble plankton skeletons. After a great expenditure of time and trouble, I had collected into four octavo plates thirty-eight photos of supposed plankton skeletons in igneous rocks. Some of the pictures are very deceptive and "convincing." Space can now only be spared for a few of the smaller ones (Plate 2C). Other observers likewise have been deceived by these nummulitic structures in chalk, Eozoon, &c.*

*) The supposed Precambrian Radiolaria figured by Cayeux (Bull. Soc. Geol. France, 22, plate 11. 1899), are, I believe, nummulitic structures. Ehrenberg ("Mikrogeologie," plate 30. B) describes parts of nummulites in the chalk of Rugen as crystalloids or morpholiths. Sorby (Ann. Mag. N. H., 1861, 8. p. 193) confuses Ehrenberg's crystalloids with coccoliths. Hahn ("Die Urzelle") makes several genera of algae and a worm out of the discoid and funnel-like parts of the pillars of the same Foraminiferan. The "spheres" of chalk have been mistaken for Radiolaria, Foraminifera, &c. (Mem. Geol. Survey, 1903, "Cretaceous," 2. p. 501). 

In spite of very careful search, I am at present unable to produce indubitable evidence of the existence of a single plankton skeleton in igneous rocks. Why, then, do I entitle this book "Benthoplankton"?* This name is chosen because the circumstantial evidence is strongly in favour of the theory that a portion of the silica of igneous rocks comes from the skeletons of organisms, and especially of plankton organisms. See Chapters 1 and 2 on "The Ocean" and "Chalk." The soluble silica of the skeletons had dissolved, and had silicified and silicated the nummulite shells amongst or above which they had fallen.

*) Benthos — organisms living at the bottom; plankton — those living at or below the surface of the water. A benthoplankton ooze or rock is one made of a mixture of benthos and plankton skeletons. Igneous rocks are here described as benthoplankton, even though no plankton skeletons persist, because the evidence is in favour of the theory that part of the silica of those rocks is derived from plankton organisms. Benthos, plankton, and benthoplankton are used either as adjectives or substantives.

Looking back over the history narrated above, it is now easy to detect the fatal flaw in the "Plutonic mail."*

*) Playfair's "Illustrations," p. 279. Adopting the analogy used by the illustrious Dr. Playfair, it may now be said with truth that the Neptunian scale-armour is absolutely impenetrable to the prongs of Plutonian pitchforks. 

When the fallacy of Werner's coal-combustion theory of volcanoes was detected,* lava came to be regarded as an "igneous" rock of deep origin and not as a heated superficial aqueous rock. One variety of the "igneous" theory — for there are several — is clearly stated by Whitney and Wadsworth in their memoir on the igneous rocks: "The original crust of the earth must have been azoic, if we adopt the views held by the large majority of geologists that our globe has cooled down from a former condition of igneous fluidity. The volcanic and eruptive rocks must necessarily be azoic _because they have come from the heated interior of the globe, reaching the surface in a melted condition_. We do not, however, designate the eruptive and volcanic rocks as "Azoic"; the fact that they are necessarily in this condition is assumed as something self-evident."* The Neptunian theory of the aqueous origin of basalt though correct was obviously a pure guess. Neptunists, for instance, defended with incredible obstinacy the view that basalt had been deposited from water in the place where it was found (Appendix, Note A). Plutonists, on the other hand, were right concerning the ascent of basalt as a molten magma; but their denial of the aqueous origin of the rock has, for over a hundred years, falsified scientific speculation concerning the real nature of the planetary crust (Appendix, Note P).

*) For it soon became impossible to escape seeing the identity of the Auvergne lava and basalt. In this district basalt lies on granite, below which no Wernerian could imagine coal to exist. Here, then, were volcanic rocks remote from burning coalfields.

*) Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. Harvard, 1884, 7. p. 534. J. D. Whitney and M. E. Wadsworth, "The Azoic System."

Volcanoes and lava streams are heaps and masses of silicated nummulitic limestone, i.e., they are of aqueous and organic origin. All the rest of the igneous rocks are of a similar nature and origin. Seeing that these rocks and the sediments derived from them constitute the bulk of the planetary crust, it follows that the lithosphere is mainly composed of silicated nummulitic rock. It will be shown that the ocean floor is almost certainly formed of nummulitic deposits, even in areas covered with recent plankton dust.

Eocene nummulitic limestones thousands of feet thick extend across north-west Africa, Europe and Asia, from Morocco and Spain to Japan, forming the middle and upper parts of great mountain-chains. This "nummulitic epoch" is not an isolated event, for nearly the whole planetary crust is made of nummulitic rocks in the form of chalk and other limestones and igneous rocks. Rocks are sometimes classified as fossiliferous and unfossiliferous, but all are fossiliferous. Again, they are classed as igneous, sedimentary and precipitated; but igneous rocks _are_ precipitated, and sedimentary rocks are precipitated rocks ground down. Really, then, there is, broadly speaking, one rock, viz., benthoplankton.

The materials composing the vast bulk of the planetary crust may be classified as follows:

Marine Benthoplankton deposits  
│  
└───Submarine, (clay surface of ancient benthoplankton deposit plus recent benthoplankton)  
│  
└───Supramarine or land (hardened benthoplankton deposits)  
|...│  
|...└───Sediments of igneous rocks and limestones  
|...│  
|...└───Original deposits  
|.......│  
|.......└───Much altered (igneous rocks)  
|.......│  
|.......└───Not so much altered (marine limestones)

Remarks on the above table. — Marine benthoplankton deposits are mainly composed of the skeletons of unicellular organisms; in the case of non-igneous rocks, Corals Mollusca Brachiopoda Echinodermata and Algae contribute largely. Remains of fresh-water benthoplankton and of land faunas and floras are, relatively to the mass of the planetary crust, almost negligible; and, moreover, they are mixed up with sediments of marine benthoplankton. I have found nummulitic remains even in coal cinders, as well as in slates, sandstones, grits, muds, sands, etc., from many localities.

The planetary crust, so far as it is accessible to observation, is composed of mineralized organic remains, the bulk of these being silicated nummulite shells. The lithosphere is veritably a silicated nummulosphere.

My statements concerning the igneous rocks have not yet been accepted. Some even declare it is not necessary to search these rocks in quest of organic remains, the theory of organic origin being manifestly absurd.

An attitude of this kind is not surprising in view of the history of the Eozoon controversy; and countless observations have been made on rock-sections, without any trace of organic structure being detected. Yet how frequently evidences of some new truth have escaped notice till attention has been specially drawn to them!

At one time it was said no organic life could exist in the great abysses of the ocean. In these sunless depths there would be no plant life, on which animal life must, in the long run, subsist; and further, animals, even if they could exist, would have to be supported by enormous cuirasses to withstand the assumed high pressure. In fact, it was physically and biologically impossible for animals to live in great depths. Actual dredging in great depths soon dispelled all these fallacies by revealing a rich abyssal fauna. A slender zoophyte dredged from 2900 fathoms in the Central Pacific almost melted on deck before the eyes of its captors. So with the theory of the existence of organic remains in igneous rocks. _Solvitur spectando_.

I shall now briefly reply to certain criticisms and objections:—

1) That no traces of organic remains could survive in rocks that had once been molten.

Dr. J. F. Bottomley, of the Thermal Syndicate, Newcastle-on-Tyne, very kindly undertook, at my request, to melt a piece of Radiolarian earth in an electric furnace. At about 1700° C. the earth completely melted, forming when cooled a dark glassy bead. Sections of the latter show very distinct organic structures. Plate 2E, Fig. 21, shows nummulitic structure. The photo shows traces of nummulitic disk-structures.

With the kind help of Prof. W. H. Merrett and Mr. H. M. Chappie of the Royal School of Mines, pieces of the same earth were subjected to a temperature of 1600° C. in a Meker furnace. When the oxygen was turned on the earth became glowing white hot. Just at the melting point it was cooled down and sections were cut from the resulting slag. Radiolaria are so very clearly visible that it is possible to determine the species (Plate 11, Fig. 49). The temperature of lavas varies from 900° C. to 1500° C.* The melting point of silica is 1600° C., but that of silicates depends on the composition, the basic being more easily fusible than the acid — basalt, for example, being more tractable than trachyte or granite.

*) _Fide_ Prof. J. P. Iddings, "Lectures on Vulcanism," London, 1914.

2) That the supposed organic remains in igneous rocks may be of accidental origin.

The suggestion has been made that the skeletons said to be found by me in igneous rocks may be recent deposits or incrustations; or the rock when in a molten state may have licked up the organic remains.

If a plug of granite one hundred metres long and, say, one centimetre in area, were cut out of the De Lank granite quarry in any direction, and cut into sections 0.1 mm. thick (_i.e._, into one million sections), I am justified in stating that traces of organic remains would certainly be found in every section.

3) That the author has not had sufficient experience to justify him in publishing opinions on igneous rocks.

It has more than once been hinted to me, and in no unfriendly manner, that I am dealing with matters beyond my special province. There is indeed an appearance of this, but in reality, so far as main issues are concerned, I am on my own ground. Knowledge of the chemical composition and mineral characters of every rock on earth avail — I will not say nothing — but very little. What is needed is some knowledge of nummulites, and practice in examining these shells with the hand-lens and compound microscope.

Tow-netting and dredging in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean have familiarised me with the exceeding richness of oceanic life. During the last year and a half I have travelled over England and Wales from Sunderland to Land's End and from St. David's Head to the Norfolk coast, to examine igneous rocks and limestones _in situ_ and to collect material. With the help of colleagues I have obtained specimens and collections of minerals from many parts of the world.

Lastly and chiefly, as a result of innumerable microscopic observations, I have acquired a certain degree of specialised skill. The eye has been trained to appreciate delicate structure, and to trace the various stages of degradation and alteration in nummulite shells found in igneous and other rocks from the Eocene to the Laurentian.

The book is divided into four parts.

In Part 1 evidence is brought together showing the strong _a priori_ reasons for believing in a theory of organic origin of igneous rocks. It is pointed out that an origin of this kind is such as might well be expected to result from the operation of the laws of nature.

A chapter on the ocean is followed by one on a typical benthoplankton rock, viz., chalk. Next follows a chapter on a more changed rock of a similar nature, viz., Eozoon, and, again, one on those still more changed benthoplankton structures commonly known as igneous rocks and meteorites. In Part 2 is given a description of the genus _Nummulites_, followed by an account of the occurrence of nummulites in igneous rocks, meteorites, etc. Part 3 refers briefly to certain speculations on the origin of life.

Part 4 contains a description of certain pseudomorphs commonly known as _Stromatoporoids_, _Receptaculitidae_, _Archaeocyathus_, _Girvanella_, _Loftusia_, etc.

I am deeply indebted to my colleagues in the Geological, Mineralogical, and Bibliographical Departments of the Natural History Museum for much kind help. Further, I have been granted many privileges by the Museum authorities, especially in being permitted to study valuable type collections of fossils, meteorites, etc.

I take this opportunity of expressing my grateful acknowledgments to Mr. L. M. Lambe, Mr. R. A. Johnston, and Mr. A. T. McKinnon, officers of the Geological Survey of Canada, who sent me at my request a magnificent set of minerals collected at Côte St. Pierre, Quebec, the classical Eozoon-ground, and transported with much difficulty to Montreal for shipment. One royal example of "Eozoon canadense" weighs over a sixth of a ton.

The friendly sympathy of some who have followed my work has been a valuable aid. Geschworner G. Henriksen of Minde, Bergen, especially has endeavoured to call the attention of scientific men to the new discovery.

I have been fortunate in securing the services of Mr. P. Highley. I think no one has had more experience in drawing from the microscope. He was making drawings of Eozoon for Dr. Carpenter forty years ago. Thanks are due also to Messrs. Raines, of Ealing, who have taken great pains to secure good photographic results, and to Mr. Butterworth for careful cliché work.

Also I would gratefully refer here to the very patient and skilful work of Messrs. William Clowes and Sons.

NOTE. Anything of scientific value in "Nummulosphere" Parts 1 and 2 is incorporated in Part 3. The first two parts, which are no longer of use, have been of the nature of stepping-stones that have helped me, in spite of much initial error, to arrive at the truths explained in the present work.

_Postscript_. The irregularity in the numbering of the plates is due to the suppression of many of the earlier plates even after the latter had all been printed off.

The original title of Part 3 viz., "Sea-Floors or Benthoplankton" (see page-headings) has been changed to "The Ocean Floor or Benthoplankton." The designation "Nummulosphere" refers to the fact that one of the concentric planetary layers (viz. the earth's "crust") is almost wholly composed of mineralized nummulites, the other zones being atmosphere, hydrosphere and centrosphere.

#### Chapter 1

##### The Ocean

"Ocean, the parent of all." — Iliad 14. 246.

The words of the poet are literally true. For both the emerged land area and the submerged oceanic area of the planetary crust are almost wholly products of the ocean, and born of its substance, and life is the chief agency that has brought about this result.

In the course of a long sea-voyage, the traveller in some swift, high-decked ship, though he may frequently see dim forms of fish or medusae swimming in the depths, and also flying fish, porpoises, and other marine creatures, yet is apt to get an impression of boundless areas devoid of life.

To him, and even to naturalists acquainted with the wonderful richness of oceanic life, the idea of the birth of the earth's crust from "the unapparent deep"* may well seem chimerical. Nevertheless the facts relating to the surface-life of the ocean, and to the nature of the ocean-floor and of igneous rocks, all point to the oceanic and mainly organic origin of the planetary crust.

*) Smooth tropical seas in moderate depths often seem almost as transparent as air or crystal. In Milton's grand line, "The birth of nature from the unapparent deep," the deep is the void of space.

##### The Surface of the Ocean

If, with the aid of a water-telescope to banish reflections, we look down through the clear waters off some tropical island of the East Indies, say Java,* we may see on the sea-bottom great masses of coral, gigantic Tridacnas and huge Neptune's-Cup Sponges. All these massive constructions began life as minute soft specks of living substance, which, in the course of their growth, extracted from the sea the carbonate of lime and silica of their skeletons. It is not, however, these large organisms that we must regard as world-builders, but, rather, certain kinds of minute shells. The white sand on the floor of the submarine garden will be found to be very rich in small calcareous shells of Foraminifera. In tropical latitudes, Foraminifera sometimes form reefs and banks obstructing navigation. The boring into the Funafuti coral-atoll revealed the fact that the reef was to a considerable extent built of Foraminifera.

Round the green coasts of Java's palmy isle."

*) "The Age of the Earth." "Funafuti: the Study of a Coral-Atoll." W J. Sollas.

Nummulitic limestones many thousands of feet thick and chalk one thousand feet thick are exceedingly rich in these shells. Further, if igneous rocks are examined with sufficient care they also will be found to be built chiefly of Foraminifera in which the carbonate of lime has become replaced by silicates.

For one of the sources of the silica that forms such a large proportion of the earth's crust we must look elsewhere than to the floor of the sea.

Prof. W. K. Brooks in his memoir on "The Genus Salpa," when referring to the food of that pelagic Tunicate, describes the mid-ocean surface as "a living broth." This apt comparison may serve to convey some idea of the abounding life existing in and near the ocean surface. The living creatures are very small and mostly of microscopic size. Prof. Brooks gives some striking examples of the almost incredible abundance of marine life: "Salpae are often found swarming at the surface of the ocean in numbers beyond description." "The smaller species are often so abundant that for hundreds of miles any bucketful of water dipped up at random will be found to contain hundreds of them. _The food of Salpa consists of Radiolarians, Diatoms_, and other micro-organisms which float in the water. The supply of this food is unlimited." 

G. Chierchia ("Viag. _Vettor Pisani_," p. 31) writes of the Atlantic: "The zone of equatorial calms is beyond measure rich in life. Sometimes the water looks as if it is coagulated, and this condition is apparent also to the touch." Concerning Copepods, G. S. Brady writes ("_Challenger_ Narrative" 1. 2. p. 843): "The sea from the Equator to the Poles supports such vast numbers of them, that it is often coloured by wide bands for many miles." They may be compared with the herbivora on land, for their food consists of Diatoms. Further, Brady says the Copepods are an important item of food for whales in Arctic seas. Accordingly these minute "sea locusts" form a link between the smallest plants and the largest animals. 

Haeckel ("_Challenger_ Radiolaria") states: "Radiolaria occur in all seas of the world." "The development of Radiolaria in large masses is very remarkable, and in many parts of the ocean is so great that they play an important part in the economy of marine life." 

In a classical passage, Sir Joseph Hooker ("Flora Antarctica" 1. 2. p. 505) writes: "The universal existence of such an invisible vegetation as that of the Antarctic Ocean is a truly wonderful fact, and the more from its not being accompanied by plants of a high order. During the years we spent there, I had been accustomed to regard the phenomena of life as differing totally from what obtains throughout all other latitudes; for everything living appeared to be of animal origin. The ocean swarmed with _Mollusca_, and particularly entomostracous _Crustacea_, small whales and porpoises: the sea abounded with penguins and seals, and the air with birds: the animal kingdom was ever present, the larger creatures preying on the smaller, and these again on smaller still: all seemed carnivorous. The herbivorous were not recognised, because feeding on a microscopic herbage of whose true nature I had formed an erroneous impression. It is, therefore, with no little satisfaction that I now class the _Diatomaceae_ with plants, probably maintaining in the South Polar Ocean that balance between the animal and vegetable kingdoms, which prevails over the surface of our globe.... The end these plants serve in the great scheme of nature is apparent, on inspecting the stomachs of many sea-animals."

To add a final quotation, Murray and Renard ("Deep-Sea Deposits, _Challenger_" p. 281) write: "These siliceous Algae are met with everywhere in the surface and sub-surface waters of the ocean. At times they occur near the surface in enormous numbers, in great floating banks many miles in extent and several fathoms in depth." "It is ... impossible to drag a very fine tow-net through the sea-water anywhere without capturing ... these minute organisms." 

Beyond the littoral zone the ocean appeared to be tenanted solely by animals which lived by preying on each other. On land the animal-world subsists in the long run on plant-life. Hooker found that this law holds in the ocean, but the individual plants are mostly invisible. The ocean is covered with floating prairies amid which browse the Protozoa, Copepods, Salpas, etc., these in turn forming the food of marine carnivores. Since plant-life other than Bacteria and Fungi depends on sunlight, the ocean vegetation cannot live below the limit reached by the sun's rays and must necessarily be a floating flora. 

Prof. V. H. Blackman ("Science of the Sea," p. 116) classes the oceanic phyto-plankton into six groups of which only one secretes silica, viz. the Diatoms. These microscopic algae are found all over the ocean, but more abundantly in waters of relatively low salinity (Castracane, "_Challenger_ Diatomaceae"). Though the group is universal, yet many genera and species are restricted to certain areas. Castracane regards temperature as the chief barrier which prevents a cosmopolitan distribution of species.

Whether devoured or not, the siliceous frustules of Diatoms sink to the bottom, and in some areas, especially in the Southern Ocean, form a characteristic Diatomaceous ooze. Sometimes the frustules appear to get dissolved, for Murray and Renard ("Deep-Sea Deposits," p. 283) state: "It seems difficult to account for the absence of Diatom remains in some deposits, except on the supposition of removal by exposure to the action of sea-water."

It has been proved, especially by the researches of Hinde, Sollas, and Zittel, that the flint and chert of Chalk and other limestone formations is derived mainly from the skeletons of organisms. I think it is very probable that much of the silica of those hardened and crystallized Foraminiferal deposits known as igneous rocks is likewise of organic origin.

Diatoms* and one-celled plants may be compared to the base of a great pyramid of oceanic life, and there is reason to suppose this relation has held good almost from the beginning of geological time.

*) Deby regards some Diatoms as pluricellular.

The Diatoms themselves have persisted as simple cells undergoing division, the halves remaining physiologically independent. As Brooks points out, these simple algae have led an easy existence immersed in a nutrient fluid bathed in sunshine, whereas effort is the price of advance up the evolutionary scale.

These minute siliceous algae have probably existed from near the time when the ocean was born and the sun began to shine on it perhaps millions of centuries ago. The actual frustules have not yet been found among igneous rocks, but the circumstantial evidence that the silica and silicates of those organic deposits is partly derived from Diatoms and Radiolaria is very strong.

The proportion of soluble silica in sea-water is extremely small according to Murray and Irvine* one part in 200,000 to 500,000. These authors concluded that Diatoms obtained their silica from suspended clay. E. J. Allen's experiments on Diatom-culture,* apparently showing the necessity for the presence of certain vitamines in the seawater, reveal the complicated nature of the problem of metabolism in Diatoms.

*) "On Silica in Seas." Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh, 18, p. 236, 1891. 

*) Journ. Mar. Biol. Assoc. Plymouth, 10. p. 417, 1914. 

There are certain other algae that indirectly aid in the extraction of silica from the sea, viz. the zooxanthellae or "yellow cells" found in many Radiolaria. The symbiosis between the algae and their Radiolarian ally has been shown by experiment to be so effective, that the combination can be self-sufficing, the Radiolarian being able to live without capturing food.

The Diatom mud of the Antarctic forms a nutritious food for fishes and other animals. Probably the Diatoms from the surface formed part of the food supply of the nummulites that constitute the mass of the igneous rocks, the Foraminifera afterwards becoming silicated by material derived from the frustules.

The Diatoms and zooxanthellae depend on sunshine. Accordingly, I was led to modify Linnaeus' designation of the rocks as "daughters of time" and to call them "daughters of the sun."*

Summary 

At the present day oceanic life depends on the simple plant vegetation at the surface, and especially on the Diatoms, and there is every reason to believe this relation has held good almost from the beginning of geological time i.e. the beginning of the formation of the earth's crust.

The surface life of the ocean has been an important source of the silica which forms a great part of the lithosphere. The planetary crust is mainly a product* of the evolution of life.

*) From a philosophical point of view, the earth's crust might be described as a by-product of the evolutionary process, psychic development being the aim.

##### The Floor of the Ocean

Until recent times the floor of the ocean beyond a few hundred fathoms was a region of profound mystery, and consequently men of science were in complete ignorance concerning the greater part of the surface of the planetary crust. During the last sixty years, however, human ingenuity has succeeded in surveying and charting the ocean floor almost as completely and surely as if it had been laid bare to ordinary observation.

The merit of this great achievement belongs especially to the _Challenger_ Expedition (1873-76), though great credit is due to other enterprises undertaken before and since that epoch-making voyage. As a result of these explorations it is now possible to picture to the mind the submerged mountains, valleys and plains of the ocean, the weird inhabitants of the abysses and the nature of the bottom. It is this last feature that is a matter of present concern.

Sir John Murray* estimates the area of the surface of the globe at 197 millions of square miles, of which dry land occupies 54 millions and the ocean 143 millions. The ocean floor is covered with muds, "oozes" and clay. Murray classes these deposits under two groups, viz. the Terrigenous, fringing the great land areas, and the Pelagic remote from land. The terrigenous deposits (littoral muds sands and gravels, coral sand and mud, volcanic sand and mud, greensand, and green red and blue muds) covering an area of 28.6 millions of square miles are more or less composed of materials derived from land.

*) Scottish Geogr. Mag., 4. p. 1, 1888, and 6. p. 265, 1890. 

The pelagic deposits, formed either of Red Clay or of skeletons of plankton organisms,* cover an area of 114.6 millions of square miles, and are distributed as follows:—

— | Mean depth in fathoms | Area in millions sq. miles | Distribution  
_Globigerina_ Ooze | 2000 | 49.5 | Atlantic chiefly, Indian Ocean, and Pacific  
Diatomaceous Ooze* | 1477 | 10.9 | Southern Ocean chiefly  
Radiolarian Ooze | 2894 | 2.3 | Indian Ocean and Pacific  
Pteropod Ooze | 1044 | 0.4 | South Atlantic  
Red Clay | 2730 | 51.5 | Eastern Pacific chiefly, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean  

*) Nummulites are abundantly present in _Globigerina_ and Diatom-oozes. In Nummulosphere 1 I unnecessarily suggested adding the designation "palaeonummulitic" to the names in use. The nummulites in the above oozes are probably derived from subaerial and submarine eruptions. In depths greater than 2700 fms. calcareous plankton dust is dissolved, and the clayey surface of the probably universal nummulitic deposit is left bare.

*) See Appendix, Note L.

The results of the _Challenger_ dredgings so far as concerned the first three deposits in the above list did not come as a surprise, for scientific men were already familiar with _Globigerina_- and Diatomaceous oozes and with fossil "oceanic" deposits of Radiolaria; but the "capital discovery" — to use Huxley's expression — that at a mean depth of 2730 fathoms and over an area of 51.5 millions of square miles there existed a deposit of red clay, was something wholly new and unexpected. At first the clay was thought to be the finest detritus of the land, but this hypothesis was soon found to be untenable.

A remarkable feature about the deposit was the almost entire absence of shells of pelagic Foraminifera, which were abundant in neighbouring areas of less depth, and which flourished at the surface of the ocean above the Red Clay. The absence of the shells was attributed to their being dissolved in the course of their very slow descent in the greatest depths.*

*) Dittmar considered sea-water to be the chief dissolving agency of calcareous skeletons, the carbonic acid being apparently already held up. Murray believed carbonic acid derived from decomposing organic matter inside the shells to be an additional dissolving agency ("_Challenger_ Narrative," 1. p. 981). Possibly, too, carbonic acid, however formed, would gravitate slowly to the deepest troughs; but if so, the amount is not sufficient to prevent or to destroy life.

Sir Wyville Thomson* came to the conclusion that Red Clay was the residue or ash of the calcareous organisms left after the removal of the carbonate of lime. When samples of _Globigerina_ ooze were carefully washed and treated with weak acid, after the carbonate of lime had been removed there remained a small residue of reddish mud composed of silicate of alumina. Huxley, who accepted provisionally Wyville Thomson's theory, writes:* "So long as the _Globigerinae_ collected at the surface have not been demonstrated to contain the elements of clay, the _Challenger_ hypothesis, as I may term it, must be accepted with reserve and provisionally, but, at present, I cannot but think that it is more probable than any other suggestion that has been made. Accepting it provisionally, we arrive at the remarkable result that all the chief known constituents of the crust of the earth may have formed part of living bodies; that they may be the "ash" of protoplasm, ...." Wyville Thomson's theory was incorrect, the fallacy in it having arisen owing to the omission to wash the samples of _Globigerina_ ooze with _sufficient_ care before dissolving them in acid. There is no clay residue to be got from clean pelagic shells gathered from the surface. The residue from shells lying on the bottom is simply that which has permeated them from the surrounding clay. Murray ("Deep-Sea Deposits," footnote p. 190) states that Wyville Thomson himself gave up the idea that the calcareous shells contained silicate of alumina.

*) "On some of the Results of the Expedition of H.M.S. _Challenger_," 1875.

Huxley's supposition concerning the organic origin of all the rocks — in the absence of the definite data now available — showed prescience and insight on the part of its author. He clearly saw how defective were the various theories concerning the nature of Red Clay, for he writes (l.c.): "I think it probable that we shall have to wait some time for a sufficient explanation of the origin of the abyssal red clay," and again, "It must be admitted that it is very difficult, at present, to frame any satisfactory explanation of the mode of origin of this singular deposit of red clay." Seemingly the answer to the riddle of the red clay has been found, and that answer helps to solve at the same time the problem of the planetary crust as a whole.

In 1877* Sir John Murray advocated the theory that the clay in pelagic deposits was a volcanic product derived from subaerial and to a lesser degree submarine eruptions. He and M. Renard adopted the volcanic theory in the report on "_Challenger_ Deep-Sea Deposits," M. Renard attributing a more important role to submarine eruptions.

*) "On the distribution of Volcanic _débris_ over the Floor of the Ocean." Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin. 9. p. 247 (1876).

In 1913 I examined the _Challenger_ deep-sea deposits and found that the samples of red clay were masses of compressed "nummulite" shells with sparsely scattered plankton skeletons embedded in them. Further investigation has shown that they belong to the genus _Nummulites_. It is possible to distinguish parts of the shells with a hand-lens, and under higher powers the nummulitic tubulated structure so characteristic of the genus (Fig. 1). These clay shells are present in all pelagic deposits, and also in abyssal terrigenous red and blue muds, but in red clay their presence is not masked by the calcareous plankton skeletons so abundant in some of the other pelagic oozes. Naturally it is difficult to find traces of nummulites in a ninety per cent. _Globigerina_ ooze, but they can be detected in a half and half _Globigerina_ ooze such as the one from Station 129 (South Atlantic, 2150 fathoms), where the carbonate of lime and silicates are in about equal proportions. Traces of clay shells, perhaps of volcanic origin, are present even in the nearly pure Radiolarian ooze from Station 225, 4475 fathoms, the deepest _Challenger_ sounding.

What, then, is the origin of the clay distributed over the ocean floor? I believe there are three sources, two of which, viz. subaerial and submarine volcanic eruptions, have already been indicated by Murray and Renard. Many of the great volcanoes border on the sea. During violent eruptions huge columns of dust and ashes are shot up miles high into the air, where they spread out over land and sea like a great pall blotting out the light for days together.* Air currents distribute the dust over vast areas, and on land, rivers carry down great masses of pumice to the sea, where they float for long periods till they sink water-logged to the depths.

*) During the eruption of Katmai in Alaska in June, 1912, darkness prevailed for sixty hours at Kodiak Island 100 miles away from the volcano, and the fumes reached Vancouver Island, 1500 miles away, the whole country for thousands of square miles being covered with a layer of volcanic dust about a foot thick. During the Krakatoa eruption the pall of darkness extended 276 miles away from the centre, and dust fell 1800 miles away. G. C. Martin, "The recent eruption of Katmai Volcano in Alaska." National Geographical Magazine, February, 1913.

Murray and Renard give many reasons for regarding submarine eruptions as a source of abyssal clay. It would be difficult on any other theory to account for the presence of vitreous lumps as large as walnuts in pelagic deposits remote from land. For these compact masses of volcanic glass could hardly have been transported either by air or water, but must have originated in the neighbourhood where they occur.

Mr. James Chumley of the "Challenger Office," Edinburgh, very kindly sent me at my request a typical piece of volcanic glass from Station 293, 2025 fathoms in the centre of the Western Pacific. The nearest land is the little speck of Easter Island 800 miles away. The precious fragment, about the size of a pea, is 7 x 5 x 5 millimetres in dimensions. A black glassy part is surrounded by brown bands of palagonite. Certainly the fragment has had an organic origin, for under the microscope it is not difficult to see indubitable and abundant evidences of nummulitic structure.

If — as Murray and Renard believe — this fragment has been ejected from a submarine volcano, it will afford evidence concerning the deeper parts of the ocean floor itself.

The presence of air- or water-borne products of land volcanoes on the floor of the ocean is of no special interest, but momentous conclusions must be drawn if material from some deep zone of the abyssal floor is found to be of organic origin. For we should learn that the Red Clay is not a mere superficial accumulation, but the surface layer of a deposit attaining a thickness of hundreds or thousands of feet — like the igneous rocks and nummulitic limestones on the land or emerged area of the planetary crust. Subaerial and submarine eruptions seem to me inadequate as sources of the whole of the oceanic clay. Murray and Renard record that "the sounding-tube sometimes penetrated to a depth of nearly two feet in the Red Clay."

Even if the deposit had only this small depth, it would be assuming a good deal to suppose that products of volcanic eruptions had been spread over an area of over 56 millions of square miles of ocean floor. The abyssal red clay areas are mostly remote from land, and probably very little air- or water-borne material would ever reach them. Even the finest land sediments would sink not very far from shore owing to the ionized condition of the seawater.* In my opinion Red Clay is partly the decomposed surface layer* of a vast formation of nummulitic so-called "igneous" rock thousands of feet thick.

*) Joly, "Radio-activity and Geology," p.123.

*)It is, however, of little importance for the present argument, whether the clay floor of the ocean is the decomposed original surface of the rock, like, for example, the surface of a Cornish moor, or whether that floor is made of formerly deep-seated erupted material of the same rock.

As stated above, human ingenuity has only succeeded in penetrating "nearly two feet" into the deposit. What are the grounds, then, for supposing that deposit to be thousands of feet thick?

New facts have recently come to light showing that the vast bulk* of the emerged or land area of the planetary crust is a deposit of nummulites. Certainly one third, and almost certainly the whole, of the oceanic area of the planetary crust is formed of a clay composed of silicated nummulites (admittedly derived in small part from land volcanoes). The difference between the emerged and submerged areas is simply one of position. Essentially and fundamentally they are identical, i.e. they are parts of a probably universal benthoplankton deposit of silicated nummulites.

*) I.e. igneous rocks and their sediments and most of the marine limestones.

Nature has not only helped us to understand the nature of the submerged ocean floor by pushing up above the water 54,000,000 of square miles of the crust of the globe for comparison, but by means of submarine eruptions she has provided us with materials, otherwise wholly unobtainable, from regions deep below the abyssal floor.

The bulk of the land area, a great part and probably the whole of the ocean floor, and materials from deep below that floor are nummulitic.

Murray and Renard write ("Deep-Sea Deposits," p. 189): "With some doubtful exceptions, it has been impossible to recognise, in the rocks of the continents, formations identical with these pelagic deposits." Leaving aside the recent plankton elements of ocean deposits and the clay derived from subaerial eruptions, the whole of the rest of the clay and Red Clay seems to me to be the decomposed part of igneous rocks identical biologically and petrologically with igneous rocks on land.

The plateau of Clee Hill or a Cornish moor are fundamentally identical with the abyssal ocean floor. In all three cases there is a surface layer of decomposed nummulitic rock.

Pieces of igneous rocks from quarries show all gradations from the fresh dense crystalline rock to a thick brownish surface crust that can be powdered between the fingers.

The products of abyssal submarine eruptions are found to be of organic origin, and to afford proof that Red Clay is only the surface layer of a very thick deposit; but we are not dependent for our evidence on rare products got with great difficulty from the abysses of the central Pacific. Many of the volcanic islands scattered over the ocean rise from deep water. These _emerged_ submarine volcanoes are masses of nummulitic rock. A lump of rotten trachyte containing sulphur, which I took hot from the upper crater of Tenerife, is little else than a mass of fossil nummulites (Plate 21. Fig. A, B). Does it not become clear that these huge volcanic heaps of mineralized Foraminiferal deposits are simply local upheavals of a very thick universal formation?

There is one other point to mention here. Although the bathy metric range of many species of Nummulitidae is very great, yet it is wholly certain the huge deposits of nummulites never lived where their clay models are found in depths below 2,500 fathoms. Undissolved lime has only a very precarious and limited existence in such depths. It is improbable that the living surface layer of these vast deposits of shells existed in depths below 1,000 fathoms. The ocean bottom itself affords clear evidence that over vast areas it must have sunk from a lesser depth to its present position.* 

*) Certain coral reefs appear to afford evidence concerning local sinkings of the ocean floor. Assuming that the coral at the lower end of the Funafuti boring was in the position in which it grew and that it was not talus, then the Funafuti area must have sunk at least 140 fathoms.

_Summary_. — The ocean floor is carpeted with terrigenous deposits in the neighbourhood of land and, in abyssal areas remote from land, with skeletons of plankton organisms, excepting in certain very deep areas where a clayey deposit is exposed owing to the failure of the calcareous remains to reach the bottom.

The clay — apart from a limited amount due to subaerial eruptions — is derived partly from the decomposed surface-material of a submarine silicated nummulitic rock, and partly from deeper-seated erupted material of the same rock. The oceanic floor and land area are respectively the submerged and emerged parts of a probably universal deposit of nummulite shells — the Nummulosphere. The bulk of the emerged part of this deposit has become hardened, mineralized and crystallized, and is known as igneous rock.

##### On the Probable Former Existence of a Universal Ocean

Werner believed that a universal ocean once covered the globe above the highest mountain-tops, the mountains being masses of minerals deposited from the sea _in situ_. So indeed they were, but not in Werner's sense. Werner knew little of the subterranean forces of upheaval. It never occurred to him to level the mountains below the water, so he brought the water above the mountains.

The discovery of the real nature of igneous rocks strongly supports the theory of a formerly universal ocean. The land area and the oceanic area of the earth's crust are now found to be the sunk and upheaved parts of a universal deposit of mineralized nummulite shells. The abyssal ocean floor must have sunk between one and two thousand fathoms. The whole land area up to the summits of the highest mountains has been below the sea.

The mean height of the land* is only 375 fathoms, the mean depth of the ocean 2080 fathoms. If the solid land were levelled beneath the ocean, the surface of the earth would be covered by an ocean with a uniform depth of two miles.

*) "On the Height of the Land and the Depth of the Ocean." Sir John Murray, Scottish Geogr. Mag., p. 1, January, 1888.

At the present day five-sevenths of the area of the globe is covered with ocean. The remaining two-sevenths or land area would be submerged by a rise of between one and two thousand fathoms in the ocean bed; and it must be remembered that the land has not been stationary, but has actually been submerged.

Some astronomers believe the earth will in course of time become waterless like the moon. If this be so, as the earth is already very old, this drying up process may by this time have made some progress. C. L. Bloxam ("Chemistry," ed. 3, p. 39) writes: "In its chemical relations water presents this very remarkable feature, that although it is an indifferent oxide" (i.e. neither acid nor basic) "its combining tendencies extend over a wider range than those of any other compound." Many minerals hold more or less permanently in the solid state water of crystallization and of constitution.

Again, living substance has extracted a vast quantity of solids from the "universal solvent" to form the planetary crust. Accordingly there was more liquid and less solid at one time than there is now, the solid kernel of the globe having been smaller to the extent of the thickness of the lithosphere, and the ocean mantle deeper.

The areas of existing continents were, in primitive times, much restricted in comparison with their present size, and even those restricted areas were former sea-bottoms. The possibility, however, of existing ocean basins having been continents must not be left out of account.

The solid planetary surface with its organic crust has been heaving up and down like a troubled sea: and taking the above circumstances into account it is probable that the ocean has extended over a greater area of the globe than at present, and, during the earliest period, even over the whole area.

##### Summary of Chapter 1

An abundant siliceous micro-fauna and -flora live at the surface of the ocean, and probably have done so for aeons. The skeletons sink, in time dissolve, and permeate benthos deposits. The ocean floor is formed chiefly of ancient mineralized deposits of nummulites, the surface layer being clayey. Near land these deposits are covered with water- or air-borne land materials (themselves nummulitic); and in the open ocean, in depths less than 2700 fms., with plankton dust chiefly calcareous; in greater depths the nummulite deposits are exposed as grown _in situ_ or as erupted _in situ_. The land is also composed of mineralized nummulites. Apparently the abyssal ocean-floor has sunk, for almost certainly nummulites did not live in depths over 1000 fms. Probably there was once an universal ocean.

_Postscript_. — My first preparations of Red Clay, _Globigerina_ Ooze, Diatom Ooze and sulphury trachyte from the crater of Tenerife consisted chiefly of crushed particles. Later, excellent sections were made showing nummulitic structure. The nummulites of the Diatom Ooze from the Southern Ocean (St. 157, 1950 fms.) come probably from ice-borne erratics and pumice. Yet nummulitic deposits formed _in situ_ are probably universal, even where covered with plankton dust. For the nummulitic masses (igneous rocks) of the Antarctic continent have emerged in an oceanic area now carpeted with Diatoms. The nummulitic mass of Tenerife has emerged in an area now covered with _Globigerina_ ooze (see "_Challenger_ Deep-Sea Deposits," Charts 5, 6). The volcanic glass, dredged from 2025 fms. South Pacific (St. 293, _Challenger_), occurs in _Globigerina_ ooze, and was very probably erupted locally. The bulk of the land area of the globe and the Red Clay (105 million square miles) bear in themselves the evidence concerning their nummulitic origin.

_Note_. — Referring to the quotation from Bloxam on p. 41. In the contest between liquid and solid, notwithstanding the great solvent powers of water, yet the balance apparently leans towards solidification. Not only have the rocks of the earth's crust been abstracted from solution, but the minerals composing them are not rarely hydrated, as in the case of the serpentines for example.

#### Chapter 2

##### Chalk and Flint, and other Limestones

A great chapter of the history of the world is written in the chalk. Few passages in the history of man can be supported by such an overwhelming mass of direct and indirect evidence as that which testifies to the truth of the fragment of the history of the globe which I hope to enable you to read.... Let me add, that few chapters of human history have a more profound significance for ourselves. I weigh my words well when I assert, that the man who should know the true history of the bit of chalk which every carpenter carries about in his breeches pocket, though ignorant of all other history, is likely, if he will think his knowledge out to its ultimate results, to have a truer, and therefore a better, conception of this wonderful universe, and of man's relation to it, than the most learned student who is deep-read in the records of humanity and ignorant of those of Nature. — "On a Piece of Chalk." Huxley.

Huxley's eloquent testimony concerning the value of a knowledge of chalk would, perhaps, have been even more emphatic had he known that the history of this rock was essentially an epitome of the history of the earth's crust as a whole: and, further, that "a piece of chalk" was fundamentally identical in its nature and origin with granite lava and meteorites, probably with many shooting stars, and possibly with some comets. For chalk is an old sea-bottom composed of skeletons of benthos and plankton organisms, the planetary crust is a still more ancient benthoplankton sea-bottom, and meteorites are now found to be lumps of ancient benthoplankton rock.

Lastly, astronomers point out the existence of relationships between meteorites, shooting stars and certain comets.

Pure chalk is mainly an accumulation of calcareous and siliceous skeletons of marine organisms. The greatest recorded thickness of the deposit is 1831 feet at Kharkov in Russia. The Chalk Ocean, according to an estimate of Dr. W. Fraser Hume, covered an area of 500,000 square miles, extending across Europe in a north and south direction from Sweden to Nice, and east and west from Scotland to Uralsk.

In very high chalk cliffs marked differences can generally be seen in the character of the rock at different levels. Usually the upper part shows numerous parallel lines of flints, lower down the flints are fewer, and at the lowest part absent. These divisions were described respectively as "Chalk with flints," "Chalk with few flints," and "Chalk without flints." This classification was soon found to be unworkable, for sometimes flints are abundant in the middle division and absent in the upper. (Appendix, Note N.)

Although the flints-classification broke down, yet more than ever as knowledge increased was the chalk found to be quite other than a mere homogeneous mass. The devoted labours of geologists, especially of Hébert and Ch. Barrois, brought to light numerous successive zones of distinct faunas, recognizable to a greater or less degree over the whole area of the Chalk Ocean floor.

No less than eleven of these zones, with subsidiary ones, are now accepted, each being named after some predominant fossil, e.g. _Holaster planus_ zone, Terebratulina zone, etc. The zones are distributed in three main divisions, known in England as Lower, Middle, and Upper Chalk, the Middle Chalk being marked off from the other two by bands of hard nodular rock (Melbourn Rock and Chalk Rock).

In 1837 Lonsdale showed that Foraminifera, small but visible to the naked eye, were very abundant in chalk.

In 1838 Ehrenberg* discovered the important part taken in the formation of chalk by still smaller Foraminifera scarcely visible to unaided vision.

*) "Über die Bildung der Kreidefelsen und des Kreidemergels durch unsichtbare Organismen." Akad. Wiss. Berlin, 1838, p. 39.

In addition, then, to the larger fossils, Chalk contains very minute ones, and these latter — Foraminifera (chiefly), Radiolaria, Diatoms, Coccospheres, etc., make up the main mass or "matrix" of the rock.

At the beginning of these nummulosphere studies I had regarded chalk as a _Globigerina_ ooze somewhat similar to that now forming over vast areas of the ocean floor. On one occasion when examining a piece of British chalk with a lens I saw something which started me on journeys to chalk-formations in all the counties of England south-east of a line from the Dorset coast to Yorkshire, for the purpose of collecting samples of Lower, Middle, and Upper Chalk, Totternhoe Stone, Melbourn Rock and Chalk Rock. Further, I read all the important memoirs on the subject dating from Ehrenberg to the present time. As a result of all this reading and investigation of material a singular impression gradually arose in my mind.

The voluminous literature on chalk reminded me of a performance of Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark. All the other familiar characters of the immortal drama were present, excepting the principal one that gave the name to the play. Every now and then a mysterious figure in various guises — in reality Hamlet, though unrecognized — would appear on the scene and flit across the stage.

_Note_. — When making a final revision I deleted Fig. 1 illustrating the nummulitic nature of chalk, owing to the figure being partly inaccurate and wholly inadequate to show what I can now see with a lens in most pieces of this rock. The following hint may help towards a realization of the strange truth that a seemingly homogeneous lump of chalk is a mass of nummulites. Imagine a lump of Eocene nummulitic limestone with small medium or large nummulites to become as soft as clay, to be pressed, later to be hardened, and, lastly, heated under pressure. There would result earthy, hard, and marmorized limestones in which the outlines of the shells would have disappeared. Soaking in accumulations of dissolved silica has resulted in silicified shell deposits, and heating and cooling have converted the latter into crystalline silicates.

I had found the piece of British chalk referred to above to be a mass of "nummulite" shells. In the list of 350 species of Foraminifera of the Upper Cretaceous rocks of Great Britain given in the Survey Report there is no mention of a single genus or species belonging to the Nummulitidae, yet I found all the lithological varieties of chalk from all levels to be mainly nummulitic. The shells belong to the genus _Nummulites_.

Parts of the shells can be discerned with less difficulty in samples weathered to a certain extent than in freshly broken material. The outlines are easily destroyed by being bruised or rubbed.

A very considerable degree of "training of the sense of sight" is required to enable the observer to distinguish the shells in sections of chalk. The nummulitic characters are more easily seen in samples poor in _Globigerina_.*

*) Munier-Chalmas and Schlumberger (Bull. Soc. Geol. France, (3), 13. 1885, p. 274) point out how greatly chalks differ in composition. Beds of Paris chalk rich in Foraminifera are stated to be "véritables exceptions," Bryozoa and Corals being abundant.

The upper chalk from the old quarry at Haling near Croydon shows well the nummulitic element. One significant feature can soon be seen in any section of chalk under a magnification of about 450 diameters, viz., a very finely and apparently uniformly dotted appearance visible in the finely granular matrix. The dots show up as dark points each in a little circle. Here and there some of the circles are slightly larger. Gradually as the eye acquires skill, it will be found the dots are really not uniformly scattered, but are arranged in more or less circular groups and disk-like groups of groups; also in thick sections series of disks may be detected passing down obliquely in the depth. After several days of practice and much patience outlines of layers of spiral lamina, pillars, seen transversely or lengthwise, furrows of marginal cord, septa and alar prolongations, will be made out. Where the shells as a whole are masked or almost obliterated by the abundance of plankton ingredients, even then portions of disk structure are always to be seen.

There remains still another method of investigation, and a highly important one. For its use will enable students, who at present may well be sceptical concerning the revelations made in this chapter, to realize the astonishing truth that the familiar chalk is veritably a mass of nummulite shells reduced to a calcareous mud. The method referred to is that of maceration.

Ehrenberg found the smallest Foraminifera of the chalk to be embedded in a matrix of still finer particles, which in the memoir already cited he describes as little granular disks.* The latter, which often appear as beaded rings,* may break down into their constituent granules. Ehrenberg concluded that as chalk had been subject to the influence of water and as the finest particles surround the small Foraminifera and are not sifted, therefore these granules must be derived from broken-down shells. He considered the particles to be concretionary bodies of an inorganic nature and to have been precipitated from the dissolved calcite of the Foraminiferal _débris_. Therefore he regarded them as "crystalloids" or "morpholiths." He found some chalks (as that of Rügen) to be half made up of this supposed inorganic material. He gives numerous figures of chalk powder macerated in water showing Foraminifera, and also morpholiths in the form of granular disks, rings and finest particles.

*) These objects are figured for the first time in Poggendorf's "Annalen," vol. 39, p. 101, Plate 1. 1836.

*) The ringed appearance is a purely optical effect due to the centre of the disk remaining invisible, especially in dark-field illumination. (See Plate 22; Fig. E, F.)

After Huxley and Wallich had discovered coccoliths and coccospheres in the abyssal mud of the Atlantic, Sorby* concluded that Ehrenberg's crystalloids were really organic objects of the nature of coccoliths. In one respect he was right, for these crystalloids are organic structures, but Ehrenberg's Plate 30 B (cited by Sorby) shows "crystalloids" which are certainly not coccoliths. In 1873* Ehrenberg still adhered to his view that the granular disklets were inorganic, and pointed out — quite correctly — how entirely they differed from coccoliths.

*) Ann. Mag. N.H., 8, p. 197. 1861.

*) Akad. Wiss. Berlin, 1873, p. 361.

He writes: "According to Sorby and Huxley the main constituent of the chalk — described by me in 1838 as oval granulated morpholithic scales and their still finer granular fragments, which, along with Foraminifera as larger elements, often constitute half the mass of the common chalk — consists of small concave animal shells named by them Coccospheres and Coccoliths. On the contrary, I have made it clear there is absolutely no cavity for the reception of an animal body in these chalk morpholiths in the form of granulated scales, and no air-vesicle giving evidence of a space, nor are there double shells for the inclusion of an animal. I have become ever more firmly convinced that these granular scales must be regarded as inorganic morpholithic products due to the change of double-refracting calcareous shells of Foraminifera into amorphous not doubly-refractive, peculiarly disposed (sich eigenthümlich ordnende) calcareous particles," I quote this in full, because literally these granular scales or disks furnish the clue to the problem of the nature of the earth's crust. Although Ehrenberg misinterpreted the meaning of the disks (Scheibchen), yet for a period of nearly forty years he persistently called attention to their existence. In spite of this, his observations have been either ignored or misunderstood by other investigators.

Murray and Blackmail judiciously describe some of the bodies in chalk resembling Ehrenberg's crystalloids as spurious coccoliths.*

*) Phil. Trans., vol. 190 (ser. B), 1898, p. 440, plate 16. fig. 4, a-b.

Lohmann* thinks the crystalloids or morpholiths (Ehrenberg's Plate 30 B) may be coccoliths, but concludes that Ehrenberg's descriptions make it difficult to arrive at a definite opinion.

*) "Protistenkunde," 1. p. 95, 1902.

Careful microscopic examination, under very high powers, of macerated chalk powder shows the granular disks to be peculiar structures — hitherto undescribed — which go to make up the entire shell of nummulites (Chap. 8). The two disks to the left in Fig. 4A are spiral bodies with the coils nearly in one plane and with radial loops or coils ("septa") in a plane at right angles to the plane of the main coil. The disks, in fact, are to a considerable degree repetitions of the complete nummulite shell. The large disks in Fig. 5 are masses of smaller disks (Plate 23. Fig. F). The beaded "rings" are not really hollow rings but solid disk bodies, a fact which becomes evident on careful focussing (Plate 23. Fig. E, E').

That the above surprising statements are correct will soon become evident to the trained observer. For any section of chalk (but preferably one not very rich in _Globigerina_) will reveal the nummulites with their coiled marginal cord, alars* and septa with granulated disks _in situ_ (Plate 22. Fig. E). The disks belong to various parts of nummulite shells.*

*) Abbreviation for "alar prolongations."

*) It is significant that Ehrenbefg found the "morpholiths" in Tertiary nummulitic limestone (Abhand. Akad. Berlin, 1855, p. 86). He would have seen them in powder scraped from the surface of any nummulite!

Chalk, then, viewed as a general formation, is a nummulitic limestone composed of a deposit of nummulite shells, in which all the other ingredients are imbedded.

Perhaps geological history will have few stranger incidents to record than the failure, after eighty years of scientific investigation, to detect the fact that chalk is mainly a deposit of nummulite shells. This failure, that has retarded the discovery of the true nature of flint, Eozoon and the igneous rocks, has not been due to lack of care on the part of very keen observers, but rather to the qualities of nummulites. The shells, formed as they are of successive layers of highly porous walls, are highly capillary and apt easily to become soaked in water and mineral solutions, to become soft and earthy or hard and crystalline, and in any case to lose their individual outlines. In purely nummulitic chalk, the shells may remain _in situ_, but where other fossils abound the mud nummulites may be pressed into cavities, or be riddled by smaller shells.

Probably a long interval separates the Cretaceous from the Eocene nummulites. Very likely many species exist in the chalk.

The methods recommended for the study of the Foraminifera of chalk are not suitable for preserving the nummulites: more damage is done in an instant of time than has been wrought by Nature in the course of millions of years. It might have been supposed that small thin-walled delicate Foraminifera would have been less resistant than large thick-walled nummulites, but this is not the case. We are advised to grate the rock into a fine powder or to macerate lumps into a paste. I cannot imagine proceedings more fatal to the integrity of nummulite shells than to grind them to powder or convert them into mud. It should be stated that Mr. Heron-Allen's methods* of maceration are excellent for the smaller Foraminifera.

*) "Prolegomena," 1894, p. 12.

I have not succeeded in isolating and cutting into sections the individual nummulite shells, though I visited the Sorbonne chiefly to examine Schlumberger's beautiful sections of Foraminifera and, if possible, to learn something of his technique.*

*) By the great kindness of Mr. C. S. Smith, British Consul-General at Barcelona, and of Mr. F. W. Abbot, I obtained a large quantity of the Cretaceous limestone of Trago di Noguera, the wonderful Foraminifera of which had been described by Schlumberger.

The above-detailed methods for showing the nummulitic characters will not leave the student in doubt for very long; these are:—

1) The use of the lens, especially on weathered examples of chalk and rough flint. I can occasionally detect shell-outlines with the naked eye.

2) The study of thick and thin sections (_a_) under powers of 300 to 400, showing the dotted appearance, the disks, pillars (series of disks) and perhaps the median and lateral chambers; (_b_) under powers of 3000 diameters, showing disk-structures.

3) Maceration of powdered chalk in water, stained or not, under medium and high powers.

The study not only of Ehrenberg's morpholiths but also of certain other mysterious objects abundant in chalk will throw light on the real nature of that rock.

Thin sections of the hard bands of nodular Melbourn Rock and Chalk Rock are very rich in peculiar bodies which Jukes-Browne* refers to as "spheres." Many theories have been held to account for them. Prof. Blake thought they looked like the hollow spheres of _Orbulina universa_. Messrs. Parker and Jones suggested they were the "separate cells of _Globigerina_ and _Dentalina_, the former predominating." M. Cayeux, who has noted their extreme abundance in the chalk, refers to them as monolocular Foraminifera of the genus _Fissurina_ (_Lagena_) or _Orbulina_. In the zone of _Inoceramus labiatus_ near Rouen, he estimates the spheres to form 95 to 98 per cent. of all the Rhizopodal fauna.

*) Geological Survey, "Upper Cretaceous Rocks," vol. 2, p. 501.

F. Chapman believed some of them to be Radiolaria. In others he saw a strong resemblance to the globate dermal spicules of certain sponges; "but the real nature of the majority of these calcareous spheres still remains an enigma." These mysterious bodies vary considerably in size, shape, and structure, being discoidal or oval, 0.08 mm. in diameter, with opaque centre and clear periphery, or clear throughout. Quite early in the present research I found these objects to be made up of nummulitic disk structures not only filling in the body but extending right across the "wall" into the surrounding matrix. I have now advanced much further, for I can see the exact position of the "spheres" in the anatomy of the nummulite shell. They occur most commonly serially along the convexity of the marginal cord and the edges of septa, also at the point where double-walled septa bifurcate within the concavity of the cord, also in the pillar-ends in the spiral lamina. Obliquely tilted disks give the _Fissurina_-aspect. Spheres, then, are clarified areas of nummulitic structure rendered glassy by becoming more calcitic or silicic owing to greater facility of diffusion of water or silica at those points. From overflow the areas may extend as in "_Saccammina carteri_" in Carboniferous deposits of nummulites. In wholly silicified deposits (Ordovician and Precambrian phthanites) the clear areas resemble Radiolaria, etc. Spheres abound in hard bands of chalk (Melbourn Rock and Chalk Rock), probably owing to increased formation of calcite or to a greater degree of dissemination of silica in disturbed or emerged zones.

Barrois considered the hard bands of chalk (bancs durcis) to be due to actual emersion. Hume thought the hard nodular condition resulted from the setting up of currents owing to alteration of the level of land bordering the Chalk Sea.

Whatever the cause, the effect has been to bring about a greater degree of dissemination of soluble silex and a greater degree of silicification of Foraminiferal structure than in ordinary chalk. It is only necessary to put a little acid on a thin section of Melbourn Rock to realize that the "spheres" owe their transparency to the fact that they are partly silicified. In ordinary chalk small defined areas have not been made glassy and, therefore, distinct; but the dotted disk structures are better seen.

Certain beds of Carboniferous limestone are almost wholly composed of minute spheroidal or fusiform bodies about 3.2 mm. (⅛ inch) in diameter and frequently produced and tubular at each end. Often several of these bodies are joined end to end in a chain. The weathered surface of a limestone rich in these structures is coarsely warty. The spheroids usually have a smooth but granular wall surrounding a clear mass of colloidal silica or of crystals of calcite. Brady* considered these bodies to be Sandy Foraminifera related to a living deep-sea form described by Sars as _Saccammina spherica_. Certainly when a chain of several little fusiform globules is isolated and mounted on a slide nothing could more closely resemble an arenaceous Foraminiferan.

*) Brady, ' Monograph, Carboniferous and Permian Foraminifera.' Pal. Soc., 1876.

Sections of typical Saccammina limestone, however, show that the Saccammina condition is due to mineralization of areas of nummulite shells, just as in the spheres of the hard chalks. Nummulitic shell-structure can be traced in continuity from the interior through the supposed walls of the spheres to the surrounding matrix. Brady figures certain "scars" in the form of granular concentric rings on the "test" of the supposed shells (Plate 12. Fig. 7, _l.c._). These structures are coiled disk-structures. Brady's drawing shows even the circles of the smaller bundles, one of the latter being equivalent to one of Ehrenberg's disklets. I can now make out in sections viewed with a lens features of the larger anatomy of the nummulites. The chain condition is found also in Jurassic oolite; and even the produced tubular structures occur, though only rarely, probably because the points have been dissolved out. Brady speaks of extensive formations of limestones being wholly made of Saccammina. The Elfhills formation, where this pseudomorph is well developed, used to be considered a concretionary limestone.

The outlines of the nummulites can be made out, but with difficulty, in lumps of the rock. The "Saccammina" condition is found in carboniferous and also in Ordovician limestones.

A peculiar spherular structure exists in the rock known as malmstone or gaize, which outwardly resembles an ordinary sedimentary sandstone, and which indeed contains to a greater or less degree sedimentary particles of sand, mica, etc. The purer varieties contain, however, a large proportion of colloidal silica.

My sections of this remarkable rock are from material which I collected from a pit near Devizes, and from the formation (referred to by Barrois) situated by the railway siding.

The siliceous spherules or "corps globuleux " in malmstone have been taken for Radiolaria, parts of siliceous sponges, silicified oolites, etc.

Some spherules resembling botryoidal structure;* and varying from 20 to 33 _μ_, were seen, under a power of 3000 diameters and low illumination, to be nummulitic spirodisks. The spherules usually show a well-defined equatorial band — the outermost coil of the disk, within which there will be lesser coils. The disks can frequently be seen to be arranged in series.

Cayeux,* in his description of a siliceous gaize of Launois, has noted therein a reticulated and radiated structure. Under a high power "ce ciment présente un aspect spongieux très particulier. Le ciment n'est ici qu'un véritable squelette de silice." The appearance of spongy structure is due to the glassy layers of spiral lamina, and of radiating alars and septa of vitrified nummulites.

*) L. Cayeux. "Contrib. à l'étude micrographique des terrains sédimentaires." Mém. Soc. Géol. Nord, vol. 4. 2, p. 21, 1897.

The colloidal silica apparently is derived partly from organisms, and partly, according to Cayeux, from decomposition of clay.

A band of flint in chalk is a layer of silicified nummulites, the silex being derived from skeletons situated in and above the once-calcareous layer.

Lapparent ("Géologie" 1. p. 332, 1906) writes:— "l'origine de cette silice doit être incontestablement cherchée dans l'alteration de dépôts siliceux origin-airement superposés aux roches en question."

In connection with this subject of "spheres" and siliceous "spherules," I shall refer here — rather than under "flint and chert" — to an interesting discovery concerning certain supposed Radiolaria.

When I found that I had mistaken for Radiolaria and Diatoms numerous "appearances" in igneous rocks, it occurred to me that other observers might have fallen into the same error, and I find this to be the case. The very transparent disk-structures strongly suggest Radiolarian lattices and spines, but very careful inspection will reveal the real structure. L. Cayeux* described numerous genera of Radiolaria and some Foraminifera from the Pre-cambrian phthanites of Brittany. I believe all these structures to be parts of the anatomy of nummulites. During a recent visit to Brittany I collected phthanites and quartzites at Port-à-le-Duc and Ville-au-Roi-en-Maroué near Lamballe, localities whence M. Cayeux obtained his material. In my opinion, the sections show clearly that all the Radiolarian Cyrtids, Dicyrtids, etc., are different aspects of nummulitic structure. I had made the same mistake in Eozoon, where I thought I had found seven genera of Radiolaria.

*) Cayeux, Bull. Soc. Géol. France, 22. p. 197, plate 11. 1894.

Dr. H. Rauff* was right in refusing to believe in the Radiolarian nature of the very minute objects faithfully figured by Cayeux, but was mistaken in assuming them to be of an inorganic nature: the statement of Hinde and Fox also, "There is no evidence to show that they were of organic origin." must be corrected.*

*) H. Rauff. Neues Jahrb. Mineralogie 1. p. 117. 1896.

*) Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc., vol. 51, p. 631. 1895.

In the case of very ancient formations it seems to me improbable that Radiolaria (or any other siliceous plankton) could have escaped being dissolved. Accordingly I think the Radiolaria described by David and Howchin* from Precambrian rocks of South Australia may be of the same nature as the supposed Radiolaria in the Precambrian phthanites of Brittany, i.e., that they may be nummulitic structures. We find then that eminent microgeologists have seen in some of the older rocks certain appearances which they have mistaken for Radiolaria. Precisely the same appearances will be found in igneous rocks and meteorites. Dissolved silica of plankton organisms and, perhaps, of sponges has diffused itself through the benthos deposits of nummulitic shells replacing the lime. The sections of pillars, marginal cord and chamber-walls of these mineralized shells frequently present a striking resemblance to Spumellarian and Nassellarian Radiolaria and to Diatoms.*

*) Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W. 1896, p. 571.

*) The picture on the cover of "Nummulosphere," Part 2, representing the genesis of igneous rocks, depicts plankton skeletons sinking through the water on to the heaps of nummulite shells constituting the ocean floor. The supposed plankton skeletons seen by me in igneous rocks are really parts of nummulites. Notwithstanding this error, the picture symbolizes events which have almost certainly happened. There is no doubt whatever about the nummulitic nature of igneous rocks, and in my opinion no reasonable doubt as to the source of much of the silica. It is a strange phenomenon this creation of the bulk of the earth's crust out of oceanic deposits of skeletons of benthos organisms mineralized by material derived partly from the siliceous skeletons of plankton organisms.

Concerning the question of the relationship between Chalk and _Globigerina_ ooze, Cayeux* clearly demonstrates that they are very distinct, especially with regard to the conditions of depth and the characters of the Invertebrate faunas. The common presence of _Globigerina_ has sometimes led to the profound dissimilarities between the two deposits being overlooked ; and even in the Foraminiferal faunas there are essential differences. For Chalk is a nummulitic limestone, and at the present day the genus _Nummulites_ is practically extinct. The nummulites met with in _Globigerina_ ooze are silicated shells derived from subaerial or submarine eruptions.

##### Flint

Although it is the carbonate of lime that chiefly strikes the eye when looking at a chalk cliff, yet the silica element is almost equally important. Even where the silica is not collected into bands of tabular flint or of nodules, there is usually a good deal of silex disseminated throughout the whole rock.

Seemingly it has been clearly proved, especially by Hinde, Sollas and Zittel, that the greater part of the silex of flint and chert is derived from the siliceous skeletons of organisms, mostly Sponges in the case of chalk.

The silex of Diatoms, Radiolaria and Sponges is in the form of colloidal silica or opal, and is fairly soluble in sea-water. Accordingly this silica tends to accumulate on the sea-floor and to sink down a little way in that floor until it meets a dense stratum through which it cannot easily permeate. In course of time the silica molecules replace the carbonate of lime of calcareous skeletons and become grouped in semi-crystalline and crystalline arrangement, the silica then being less soluble.

Some geologists have denied the organic origin of the silica, believing it to be derived from highly charged sea-water rather than from organic remains accumulated on the sea-bottom. On the one hand there is no evidence to show that sea-water is highly charged with silica; indeed, the evidence is in the other direction, and on the other hand benthos and plankton siliceous skeletons are extremely abundant on sea-floors and often persist still undissolved in flint and chert.

Dr. Hinde,* in a paper on the organic origin of chert, criticises the opinion of Professor Hull, who considered chert to be a pseudomorphic formerly-calcareous rock silicified by silica of inorganic origin. My own extremely careful observations on flint, chert, and Ordovician and Precambrian phthanites convince me that they are all silicified calcareous rocks, for in every case I can detect the original nummulites. On the other hand, direct and indirect evidence are strongly in favour of the theory of organic origin of the silica; in chalk-flint and Portland chert remains of siliceous skeletons still persist. (The supposed Radiolaria described by Hinde and Cayeux from the earlier rocks are appearances presented by the transparent nummulitic structure.) The present theory reconciles the opposing views of Dr. Hinde and Professor Hull. For flint is not a mass of dissolved siliceous skeletons. It is, as Professor Hull surmised, a mass of silicified calcareous skeletons, amidst which, it is true, there are embedded a certain average proportion of siliceous remains perhaps no greater than in any other part of the whole deposit. The calcareous skeletons are mostly nummulites, though these have not yet been generally recognized. The silica of the flint comes from the whole mass of calcareo-siliceous deposit lying between two zones of flint and including the lower zone.

*) G. J. Hinde, "On the Organic Origin of the Chert of the Carboniferous Limestone Series of Ireland." Geol. Mag. (3) 4. p. 435 (1887).

The successive layers of flints represent in a certain degree the material derived from successive ill-defined zones of organisms rather than from sharply defined beds. Sometimes flint is deposited along oblique fissures in the rock.

When rough weathered flints are examined carefully with a lens, the surface will nearly always be seen to be made of shells of _Nummulites_. Further, even the most translucent sections of flint, under high powers and suitable illumination, will show the structure, especially the "disks" of the nummulite shells. All the light should be cut off at first, and then the faintest glimmer admitted to the field. Gradually the trained eye will see the structural features of _Nummulites_. The least excess of light completely "drowns" the details. Flints, is formed of casts of Foraminifera (Appendix, Note B). Glauconite, which is a silicate of potash and alumina, is supposed usually to result from the breaking up of clay in presence of organic matter.

Concerning "Barbados Earth," see Appendix, Note M.

Scattered in the chalk are nodules of iron pyrites, which often "degenerate" into powdery lumps of oxide of iron. Country people regard the nodules as "thunder-bolts." Curiously enough these marcasite nodules actually do throw a light on the origin of iron meteorites. For both objects are "ore-enriched" masses of nummulitic rock.

The shells are best seen on finely granular fractured surfaces, especially if allowed to become weathered a little by exposure. The marcasite nodules have not formed in the void. The metallic salts have permeated a mass of Foraminiferal shells. Metallic Trilobites and Ammonites are familiar objects: the metallic nummulite shells on the other hand are indistinguishably massed together. I have seen the nummulitic structure in ore-deposits of iron, tin, uranium, etc.

##### On certain other Limestones

"Sed calx a petrificatis." — _Linnaeus_.

Calcareous formations are being built up at the present day; and right down through the ages to the Archaean Period these deposits have come into existence and have persisted as records of events in the history of Nature. In many cases we can see the mass of rock to be composed to a greater or less degree of the calcareous skeletons of organisms such as Corals, Crinoids, Mollusca, Polyzoa, the larger Foraminifera, etc., but often nothing is apparent excepting a fairly homogeneous or granular matrix.

Where no fossils or only a very few are visible, even under the microscope, it becomes a difficult question to account for the presence of the carbonate of lime.

The following extract from H. B. Brady's "Memoir on the Carboniferous and Permian Foraminifera," 1876, brings into relief some aspects of the problem referred to. He writes (p. 5):

"Take them as a whole, the Carboniferous Limestone beds of Great Britain cannot be regarded as a Microzoic formation in quite the sense in which the term is rightly applied to many Cretaceous rocks : indeed, as a rule, they owe their origin, so far as their organic constituents are concerned, much more to animals of higher organization and larger individual dimensions, such as Crinoids and Corals than to Microzoa. So far from owing its origin, like the true Chalk, chiefly to Foraminifera; or, indeed to go further, so far from being a deposit formed directly and exclusively by the agency of animals secreting carbonate of lime, _there are considerable areas of Carboniferous Limestone in which the sea appears to have deposited its excess of mineral constituents in accordance with chemical and physical laws, without the intervention to any great extent of animal life_."

"This has been brought about by a precipitation and the subsequent coalescence of the impalpable particles of amorphous precipitate into minute spheroids, the result being a concretional or oolitic limestone (often fossiliferous at the same time)... There need be no difficulty in the acceptance of a physical explanation of this sort, even by those who hold most firmly the theory that all limestones have primarily an organic origin."

Recently* numerous observations and experiments on the precipitation of calcium carbonate in sea-water have been made by and under the direction of Dr. T. Wayland Vaughan. Off Florida and the Bahamas, banks of limestone are in process of formation which owe their origin entirely to chemical precipitations from sea-water through the agency of _Pseudomonas_ (_Bacterium_) _calcis_ Drew: and, further, oolitic banks, apparently due partly to the aggregation of particles of carbonate of lime round bubbles of gas, are in process of formation.

*) Carnegie Institution of Washington, Year Books Nos. 11, 12, 13, 1912-1914.

Again, travertines, tufas, stalactites, amygdaloids, cementation of sea-floors, etc., all show that chemical precipitation of carbonate of lime is a very common occurrence.

G. Linck* states: "Oolite consists originally of a modification of carbonate of lime (Aragonite) in the formation of which organisms are not directly concerned. It is not a metabolism product of organisms."

*) "Ueber Bildung der Oolithe und Rogensteine." Jenaische Zeitsch. vol. 45, p. 276. 1909.

According to Van Hise,* "It is well known that it is difficult or impossible to discriminate limestones of organic or chemical origin." I would point out that the microscopic examination for nummulitic structure will be found to furnish an invaluable aid to diagnosis, though the test may be at times a little difficult to apply, as, for example, in the supposed non-fossiliferous matrix of Tyrol dolomites.

*) "Treatise on Metamorphism," p. 907.

As a result of the examination of numerous marine limestones of all ages, I find that, just as in Chalk, a point of fundamental importance has been overlooked. Jurassic, Triassic, Permian, Carboniferous, Devonian, Silurian, Ordovician, Cambrian and Pre-Cambrian limestones are mainly nummulitic rocks. The "matrix," whether homogeneous cannon-ball-like, pisolitic, oolitic, soft or hard, earthy or marmorized, dolomitized, silicified, silicated, or ore-enriched, will in most cases be found to consist of a mass of nummulite shells. The shells, though not easy to detect, can usually be made out with a hand lens, and the structure, especially the dotted or granulated disk-like structures, can be seen in sections under the microscope. Accordingly the carbonate of lime in all these rocks is mainly derived from organisms.

The oolitic structure not uncommon in calcareous material evidently arises in many different ways. The Jurassic Oolites are nummulitic limestones with oolitic structure, and the lime is certainly derived from the nummulites which constitute the mass of the rock. The shell-structure can be best seen in weathered material from ancient buildings. In these cases the oolitic structure which masks the shells becomes more or less dissolved out. (See Chapter 12)

My sections of typical hand-specimens of Schlern and Mendola dolomite from Seiss show that these lumps and presumably the huge masses from which they were detached are nummulitic limestones (See Appendix, Note C). Similarly with sections of marbles from various parts of the world kindly supplied to me by Messrs. Bingham.

##### Summary of Chapter 2

Chalk is a nummulitic limestone, formed mainly of a deposit of shells of _Nummulites_, a genus hitherto only doubtfully known to occur before the Eocene. Many writers from Ehrenberg to the present time have seen in Chalk objects named "morpholiths," "spheres," etc., the nature of which has been doubtful, but which are now found to be portions of nummulite shells, the spheres being concretionary areas. Numerous other limestones from Jurassic to Archaean are nummulitic; but the shells have escaped detection, and the carbonate of lime often has been regarded as a chemical deposit.

Flint is composed mainly of nummulites in which the lime has been replaced by silica derived chiefly from organisms. The silicified shells are transparent in the interior of flint, but visible again on rough weathered surfaces. Silicified rocks of all ages (quartzites, jaspers, phthanites, etc.) may show nummulitic structure, the latter sometimes having been mistaken for Radiolaria, other Foraminifera, sponge spicules, etc. [The silicated rocks known as igneous (including also meteorites) are very ancient metamorphosed nummulitic limestones fundamentally similar to chalk.]

_Postscript, Note_ 1. — I have now learned to distinguish in sections of chalk, Mendola- and Schlern-Dolomite, Jurassic oolite and Carrara marble, held up to the light and examined with a lens (3x or 10x), the larger structure of the nummulite shells, viz. the successive coils of marginal cord and the radially disposed septa and alar prolongations. Certain parallel lines in the minute particles of calcite of Carrara marble are not due to crystallization but to the organic structure of the marginal cord.

I should mention that the simple skill in detecting the above-named structures in the mass of calcareous particles has only come to me at the end of a long period of painstaking observation and that some patience is necessary. The faint outlines of the spiral central coils and radial alars of perpendicular sections or aspects of shells will be the first structures to be seen. I now prefer to use a lens magnifying only 3 diameters.

##### "Eozoon" or "The Dawn Animal"

_The story of a double delusion._

The British sedimentary strata from recent to Cambrian, if piled horizontally, would at their thickest form a mass several miles high, the lower five-sixths being palaeozoic. Birds and mammals begin to appear about one-sixth of the way down from the top, reptiles and amphibia about one-third, and fishes half-way down, the lower half being invertebrates only.* The strata may be compared to the leaves of a great folio in which is written — though very imperfectly — the record of the evolution of life from the lower to the higher stages. Beneath the Cambrian are Precambrian formations of unknown thickness, chiefly crystalline, stratified, foliated or schistose rocks (gneisses and schists), some sandstones and limestones, and volcanic rocks. They are exposed mostly in North Britain and the Hebrides. No undoubted fossils have been found in them. Once it was thought the Cambrian period was coeval with the beginning of life, but now the absence of organic remains in the older rocks is attributed rather to their obliteration.

*) These figures refer only to _British_ strata.

Precambrian rocks are widely distributed over the world, but nowhere do they attain such enormous development as in Canada, where they cover an area of about two million square miles and attain a thickness of several tens of thousands of feet (Appendix, Note D). The accumulation of this vast series of highly metamorphosed deposits possibly required a greater time than was necessary to form the strata ranging from the Cambrian to the present. So far only a few Precambrian fossils have been recorded from the American continent, some even of these being of a doubtful nature (Appendix, Note E).

Forming the base of the Precambrian in Canada is a confused assemblage of highly crystalline igneous rocks to which Sir William Logan's term "Laurentian"* is now restricted: in contact with these, in the region of the Ottawa River, there are limestones, quartzites, gneisses, metamorphosed clays and sandy-clays known as the "Grenville" series.* These sedimentary rocks are broken into by masses and dykes of "Ottawa gneiss"; the masses, notwithstanding their stratified structure, now being generally regarded as plutonic up-wellings (bathyliths) rather than as altered sediments.

*) Called after the Laurentide mountains north of the river St. Lawrence.

*) J. Stansfield, "Internat. Geol. Congress, Canada, 1913." Guide Book No. 3, p. 82. Bibliogr. Index, p. 115.

The Laurentian and Grenville rocks belong to the most ancient era, "the Archaean." They constitute the "fundamental or basal complex."

In 1858 Sir William Logan, one of the great pioneers of Canadian geology, began to suspect that certain peculiar lumps of rock found in Archaean limestone, and which had been sent in as minerals, might possibly be of organic origin. Weathered lumps showed a layered structure (Plate 2) like that of the palaeozoic stromatoporoids — which though palaeozoic had come into existence ages later.

Sections revealed a banded structure consisting of alternate white and green wavy bands of calcite and serpentine (Fig. 6).

Sir W. Dawson, who supported Logan's view, regarded the lumps as giant Foraminifera belonging to the nummulite family, the white zones being the walls of the chambers, and the green parts the spaces formerly filled in with living protoplasm. The white zones contained systems of branching "canals."

In 1862 Logan, when on a visit to London, showed the specimens to Dr. W. B. Carpenter, the highest authority on Foraminifera. Carpenter confirmed Dawson's nummulite theory, and demonstrated that in some specimens the green spaces were lined with a definite, very finely fibrillated layer, which he regarded as the proper tubulated wall of each chamber of the shell, the white bands with their branching "canals" being the "supplementary" skeleton commonly found in nummulitid Foraminifera.

In 1865, Logan, Dawson, Carpenter and Sterry Hunt* published a joint paper on _Eozoon canadense_ gen. et sp. nov. Dawson. This paper started a prolonged and stubborn controversy.

*) Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc., Feb. 1865, pp. 45-71, and plates.

In 1866 Professors King and Rowney* pointed out that all the structures brought forward by Carpenter as proofs of organic origin could be shown to be of a purely mineral nature and origin. The alternating zones, and the dendritic structures in the white bands were common in minerals, and the fibrillated so-called "nummuline" or "proper wall" was simply a fibrous or asbestiform variety of serpentine known as chrysotile.

*) Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc., Feb. 1866, pp. 185-218, and plates.

In 1878 Professor Möbius of Kiel, a high authority on Foraminifera, published a well-illustrated memoir* on Eozoon, which latter he regarded as an object of purely mineral origin.

*) "Palaeontographica" 25. p. 175.

In 1894 Professors H. J. Johnston-Lavis and J. W. Gregory* described certain bombs ejected from Monte Somma (Vesuvius), which have a zoned arrangement of calcite and silicates practically identical with that of "Eozoon canadense," excepting that the silicates are not hydrated into serpentines and there is no "nummuline" layer of chrysotile (fibrous serpentine). The authors considered the material of the bombs to be of Cretaceous or Jurassic age.

*) Sci. Trans. Roy. Dublin Soc. (2) 5. p. 259. 1893.

The problem was now considered settled. In all the chief text-books Eozoon was put down as an object of mineral origin, and science, with evident relief, pronounced its _requiescat in pace_ on the controversy. Any signs of recrudescence call forth a note of alarm — "We are threatened with a revival..."

New evidence, however, renders it imperatively necessary to exhume the dawn-animal and hold a fresh inquest. This time the enquiry need only be brief, and beyond doubt the verdict will be final.

Once when examining one of Carpenter's sections under the microscope I saw embedded in serpentine a very small object 0.1 mm. in diameter, which I took to be a young nummulite shell* (Plate 11. Fig. 42), and presently found several similar objects.* Further research apparently led to the discovery that a specimen of Eozoon was a mass of small "nummulite" shells. At first they seemed to me to be associated in colonies. The supposed shells, on an average about four millimetres in diameter, were present both in the green and white bands, frequently also one "shell" being half in the green and half in the white. Next I discovered in the sections under high powers "appearances" closely resembling Radiolaria and Diatoms.*

*) Described, but very incorrectly, in A.M.N.H. Sept. and Oct. 1912.

*) Photographed better in "Nummulosphere" 1. 1913. The photo on Plate 11 is too dark.

*) "Nummulosphere" 2. 1913.

Since "Nummulosphere" 2 was published I have made numerous observations on varied and abundant material, viz., Carpenter's collection, including "Eozoon" from Scotland, Ireland, and Bavaria (sent by Gümbel); a magnificent set of specimens sent to me by Mr. L. Lambe from Canada; material from Finland sent to me by Prof. J. J. Sederholm and Dr. O. Trüstedt; a typical Monte Somma bomb (Hamilton Coll. N. H. M.); also archaean limestone from the Sikhim Himalayas, very kindly obtained for me by Mr. John C. White.

I have now found that the small disks visible with a hand lens, and which had been taken by me for small nummulites, are portions of nummulite shells. Further, the supposed Radiolaria and Diatoms are found to be appearances due to transparent series and groups of nummulitic disk structures viewed under high powers and in various aspects; and, lastly, the supposed microscopic shells of which I had published photographs were also merely portions of nummulitic structure.

Professors King and Rowney* asked believers in the organic theory to reply without question-begging irrelevancy or reticence to eleven points, foraminiferal, mineralogical, chemical and geological.

*) "An Old Chapter in the Geological Record," 1881.

The organic theory has now taken on an almost entirely new aspect, and I think it will be amply sufficient to reply here to the first two points, which are the most important.

Point No. 1. The existence of an _upper_ and an _under_ "proper wall" in immediate connexion with a "chamber," also frequent absence of intermediate skeleton, and frequent horizontality — instead of verticality — of tubuli to the adjacent chamber.

Answer. The green bands are not chamber-spaces formerly containing protoplasm but now filled in with serpentine; there is no "proper wall" to the supposed "spaces," and there is no supplementary skeleton (in the form of white bands) between "spaces" which never existed.

There _is_ a lump of limestone in which silicates have been diffused out from some central accumulation and precipitated in zones, thereby differentiating the lump from the common limestone matrix. Careful observation shows the archaean limestone to be a nummulitic deposit similar to Tertiary nummulitic limestones, but more changed owing to long subjection to metamorphosing agencies, and especially to the proximity of igneous intrusions. Even Cretaceous and Jurassic limestones give rise to silicatic Eozoonal structure when subjected to volcanic heat as in the Monte Somma bombs.

Careful observation under high powers shows the nummulitic disk structure underlying fine fibrillar pattern, just as in the striated bands of spiral lamina in Tertiary nummulites. (See Chapter 8)

Möbius denied the nummulitic tubulated nature of the fibrils or aciculae on the ground of their occasional great length and curved shape, and their varied direction and "non-verticality." I have now found the reply to these reasonable objections. Very frequently in sections of Eozoon long fibrous bands are met with having characters such as Möbius described. They are portions of concentric bands of furrowed marginal cord with septa astride. The cord is really a wavy almost polygonal structure, and the direction of series of disk structures varies greatly in adjacent parts. Again, in oblique sections of large shells across many successive layers of spiral lamina, there is sometimes a false appearance of fibrillar continuity.

In the fine collection of serpentine minerals and rocks in the Natural History Museum there are a number of asbestiform fibrous varieties (chrysolite, metaxite) of this "protean mineral." Here the fibrous structure is a character of the mineral. I have found nummulitic structure persisting even in real asbestos, that structure being situated at any angle to the mineral fibre.

Point No. 2. "The supposed 'canal-systems' have no constant correlativeness."

Answer. King and Rowney are wholly right. The "canals" are due to mineralization, and are not canals at all, for they have never been hollow. Plate 23 Fig. G, shows two of these "canals." They are filled with nummulitic structure in continuity with similar but barely visible structures in the adjacent calcite. Solid serpentine "casts" of the canals etched out by acid are solid masses of nummulitic structure and not structureless infillings.

Dr. Hahn ("Die Urzelle") was opposed to the nummulite theory. He writes: "The assertion that Eozoon is a Foraminiferan comes to grief with the proof that it is formed of plants." Dr. Hahn thought the existence of fibre-like and also of cup-shaped canals fatal to the Foraminiferal theory. He made many genera of algae out of the "canal-systems." (I myself at one time imagined I had found algae in Eozoon.) Dr. Hahn figures a worm with a tripartite operculum, "das erste Tier" — the ancestor of Trilobites — "which browsed on this succulent vegetation" (Whitney and Wadsworth). Some figures of the worm apparently show transverse sections of spiral lamina or cord, the operculum perhaps being a pillar-end or septum. Notwithstanding his mistakes, Dr. Hahn was nearer the truth than were some of his critics.

On the weathered lumps of Eozoon I can trace with the naked eye and lens obscure outlines of large nummulites about an inch in diameter and in various aspects. Many hours of patient observation were required at first to make out the details, but I can now make out with certainty numerous details of shell structure (Plate 13. Fig. C). Sections 3x show the shells fairly well.

Under a power of 400 diameters (16 mm., Oc. 18, a useful combination) I can now see with the utmost certainty abundance of nummulitic shell structure both in the serpentine and in the calcite. I had long studied my sections without seeing what is now so obvious. In fact it was a case of not seeing the wood for the trees. Any large transparent nummulite in horizontal aspect, and showing floor upon floor of spiral lamina with range upon range of band-like alar prolongations, series upon series of conical pillars, and the concentric many-furrowed marginal cord, considerably obliterated here and there, with mottled patches of serpentine and calcite, would naturally be a very complicated mass of structure. Under lower powers it is difficult to trace the continuity, and under high ones only a very small part of a shell comes into the field; for a shell an inch across, magnified 400 diameters, would cover 120 square yards. Under this power the structural outlines are clear and indubitable. The transverse aspect shows layers of spiral lamina and pillars seen lengthwise. Very high powers show abundantly the disks, especially in their transverse aspect.

The complicated and confused reticular aspect of the shells as viewed in transparent serpentine is due to radial and concentric layers being cut at various angles. A little training and much patience are necessary to enable the beginner to discern and piece together the nummulitic pattern. The concentric circles of furrowed cord and the radial alar prolongations are good guides to orientation in shells viewed in horizontal aspect.

##### On the Origin of the banded structure in Eozoon

Many theories have been advocated to account for the white and green (calcareous and silicatic) zones of Eozoon. Firstly there is the organic theory, viz. that the calcareous zones were the skeleton of a Foraminiferan, the silicatic zones being in-fillings of the spaces of the shell. This theory may be finally dismissed.

W. J. Sollas and Cole* suggest that calcareous and silicatic zones might arise by formation of successive layers of particles of carbonate of lime and olivine on the reef-bound shores of volcanic islands. I myself have seen on the beach of Porto Santo Island layers of calcareous grains and of dark green particles of augite sifted by gentle wave-action. In places, these sandy layers have been cemented into solid stone, of which I have specimens. The calcitic and augitic bands, however, vary in thickness irregularly, whereas the bands of Eozoon diminish regularly and serially from a base or centre.

*) Sci. Proc. Dublin Soc. 7. p. 124. 1891.

Johnston-Lavis and Gregory regard the pyroxene lumps that often form the nucleus of the Eozoon as portions of an igneous magma that have been separated from the main source and grouted into a soft pasty limestone. From the nuclei thus deposited silicic vapours and fluids became diffused outwards, combining with the magnesium, calcium and iron to form ferromagnesian or pyroxene compounds, these being deposited in zones gradually diminishing in width. Firstly a thick band is formed, then another not so thick, and so on, till the material is used up.

There are two questions involved here, viz. the origin of the pyroxene and of the zonal structure associated with that material. Nothing could at first sight seem more reasonable than the views of these writers. There are always igneous masses or intrusions in the neighbourhood of Eozoon, and the zones of Eozoon, as viewed, actually do diminish in width from centre to periphery. Notwithstanding, the derivation of Eozoon from igneous material is very improbable; and, further, possibly the zones did not originate quite in the manner suggested by Johnston-Lavis and Gregory.

O. Trüstedt,* in a report on the ore-deposits of Pitkaranta, Finland, gives a picture (from a photo) of the limestone quarry of Hopunwaara. Fig. 8 below is a diagrammatic plan of the same, showing bands of "sahlit-skarn" (pyroxene), serpentine and Eozoon as they appear in the limestone. The limestone is separated from the granite by layers of mica-schist and iron-ore. 

*) Bull. Comm. Geol. Finlande. No. 19, p. 214. 1907.

If the lumps and bands of pyroxene had originated from the granite, one would expect the first ten metres of the limestone in the neighbourhood of the granite to be crowded with the pyroxene, but there is scarcely a trace, and none at all in the first five metres. 

Prof. T. G. Bonney,* who saw Eozoon _in situ_ in the limestone at Côte St. Pierre, Quebec, figures masses of pyroxene or serpentine or of both minerals surrounded by bands of Eozoon. The conditions in the Laurentian and Hopunwaara limestones are closely similar. Prof. Sederholm, who very kindly sent me specimens of Hopunwaara limestone and of other Finland rocks, thereby supplementing a set of Eozoon, sahlit, etc., previously sent by Dr. Trüstedt, writes in a letter to me:— "The limestone is Ladogian," _i.e._ it is to be correlated with the Archaean. 

*) "The Story of our Earth." 1893, p. 388, Fig. 131; also Geol. Assoc. 1895, p. 292.

All the evidence goes to show that the lumps and bands of pyroxene and their surrounding zones of serpentine belong to the limestone itself, just as the lumps or bands of flint in a chalk quarry belong to the chalk. In the archaean limestone, owing to the heat from neighbouring igneous magmas, the silica has combined with the magnesium, calcium, aluminium, iron, etc., to form serpentine, loganite, etc., the silicates being precipitated in bands. Both the flint and the Eozoon are mineralized lumps or masses of nummulite shells, the silica probably being derived from organisms.

The experiments of R. Liesegang ("Geologische Diffusionen") on precipitation, show the order of deposition of the "rhythmical precipitations" to be from periphery to centre. If, as is probable, the same law holds for Eozoon the fine outer bands of ferromagnesian silicates would be thrown down first. 

Eozoon has been a twofold source of error. Firstly there was the mistake for which Dawson and Carpenter were chiefly responsible, that certain banded lumps of serpentine limestone were gigantic reef-like Foraminifera. After doing great service in destroying this illusion, the mineralogists and petrologists went too far and fell into error themselves. Whitney and Wadsworth* write of "the extraordinary delusion which has prevailed among palaeontologists with reference to the organic nature of Eozoon."

It was a case of denying not merely the organic nature of Eozoon _qua_ Eozoon, but also an organic origin of any sort. As these authors expressly state, their "Azoic System" comprised a series of the earliest rocks which had, according to them, never been anything else than azoic. I have already given reasons for my conviction ("Nummulosphere" 1) that there is no "azoic system" accessible to investigation. Numerous later observations have confirmed this view.

King and Rowney (Q.J.G.S. _l.c._ p. 216) regard Eozoon as having "existed at one time as hornblendic or augitic gneiss, and that it is primarily of sedimentary origin," i.e. an azoic sediment derived from azoic rocks. Johnston-Lavis and Gregory (_l.c._) consider Eozoon to be derived from igneous magmas, _i.e._ to be azoic.

Eozoon is not an organism any more than is a lump of chalk or flint, but at the same time it resembles those objects in being of organic origin. For they are all masses of Foraminiferal shells, not much altered in the chalk, solidly silicified in the flint and silicated in zones in the "Eozoon." Seeing that Eozoon is neither a giant Foraminiferan nor an object of purely mineral origin, its story may justly be described as that of a double delusion.* As in so many controversies there were truth and error on both sides. The present theory will effect a reconciliation.

*) One might have said "multiple delusion," but it is only necessary to refer here to the main points in the historic controversy.

There is a vague and indefinite era in the history of the planet when geology first enters into its inheritance and astronomy withdraws.

All theories of planetary origin postulate a nebula of some kind. The Laplacean and meteoritic theories assume that a hot gaseous nebula or one of clashing meteorites condensed into a molten globe on which a crust formed on cooling. The planetesimal theory postulates a nebula of solid and liquid particles all rotating in one direction round a solid central nucleus, the latter growing by accretion. In the first case the ocean would form rather by precipitation, in the second by exudation.*

*)  Chamberlin and Salisbury. "Geology, Advanced Course,' 2. 1906.

The part of the earth's crust that might be expected to furnish evidence concerning planetary origin would naturally be in the oldest zone, _i.e._ the archaean or "basal complex."

In Canada Laurentian rocks constitute the lowest floor. Immediately over this lie the Grenville series in the Ottawa River region, and the Keewatin schists and volcanic rocks in Western Ontario.

This volcanic schistose and sedimentary series overlying the Laurentian igneous rocks has been a source of perplexity to plutonists. The problem, in fact, recalls the great "Tortoise myth." Between the schist series and igneous rocks there is no intervening floor, the contact being "intrusive" and immediate.

Now sediments and lavas must rest upon or flow over a firm floor of some sort. The difficulty has been met by assuming that a formerly existing floor has been dissolved in rising floods of molten magma.

Perhaps the difficulties above referred to may be explained in the following manner. There was certainly a time when "Laurentia" was being built up shell by shell beneath the sea. Then came a gradual upheaval, the lower deeper-seated region of the mass having undergone the plutonic kind of crystallization. During long ages Laurentia was subject to denudation. Then came a period of partial subsidence when the Grenville limestones were deposited on the submerged Laurentian floor, along with sediments from neighbouring land. Still later there was violent disturbance which once again melted the Ottawa gneisses and injected them into the crumpled layers* of the Grenville series, the heat giving rise here and there to Eozoon structure.

*) See photo of contorted Grenville limestone. Canadian Geol. Survey, 12. J. 1899, plate 4. Dawson's "oscular chimneys" in Eozoon are probably structures due to compression.

The Laurentian rocks are not primeval magmas welling up from some very deep central source, but are "daughters of time," in fact old sea-floors. The Laurentian rocks are themselves permeated by intrusive dykes. So there are sea-floors under sea-floors, "deep under deep."

Possibly the world is vastly older than has been usually believed.

Certainly the Laurentian and igneous rocks have just as much to do with nebular hypotheses as a lump of chalk has — and just as little.

The conclusion is reached that hitherto we have been studying only a thin pellicle of organic origin and have in no wise got beyond the zone of life into the azoic.

King and Rowney('An Old Chapter....,' 1881) give in the course of fifty-three pages an annotated history of the Eozoon controversy, and refer to 108 papers, memoirs, etc. In fact, Eozoon has a literature of its own. Dr. Hahn ('Die Urzelle,' p. 11) writes:— "Veritably a greater riddle than Eozoon has rarely been proposed to natural philosophy." In view of the prolonged controversy what now seems so strange is the simplicity of the problem. All that is required is to examine for nummulites. It is surprising to find that it is possible to see with the naked eye the outlines of the shells on the surface of weathered blocks of Eozoon, and to trace under a weak lens a good deal of the structure. (See Plate 13. Fig. C, and Plate 14. Figs. D, E).

The discovery of the nummulites confirms the theory of the mineralogists that the banding was a purely mineralogical feature, but at the same time indicates the organic origin of the carbonate of lime and the marine origin of the silica and magnesia.

Seemingly the _tria regna_ have each contributed to the making of the Dawn Animal, for it is a mass of nummulites mineralized by various minerals and especially by silica probably derived partly from plants.

From the point of view of rock metamorphism, Eozoon (limestone + silicate) is important as illustrating a transition-stage between ordinary limestone (limestone + silica) [Chap. 2] and igneous rocks (pure silicates) [Chap. 4]. There is a common nummulitic basis in all.

Perhaps it was well that the riddle of Eozoon was not quickly solved, for in the prolonged efforts to find the answer much valuable knowledge was acquired.

##### Summary of Chapter 3

Specimens of "Eozoon" are lumps of nummulitic limestone mineralized by silicates deposited in zones.

##### The Igneous Rocks

"It is important to acquire a hospitable and intelligent preparedness to appreciate new light as it shall present itself." — _Chamberlin and Salisbury_.

Scattered over the face of the world are mountains of a very peculiar nature. They are usually conical and with an open bowl-shaped cavity at or near the summit. From time to time in the course of years or centuries, lumps of hot rock, clouds of ashes, vapours and steam are shot up from the interior perhaps to a great height, and floods of molten rock well up and flow down the mountain side. The name "volcano" called after "Vulcano" or "Vulcan's stithy" in the Lipari Isles, expresses an ancient idea as to the nature of these mountains.

The volcanic mountain, which is an accumulation of ejecta round a pipe leading deep beneath the surface, is not an essential feature. Sometimes the molten rock has welled up through one or many fissures in the ground. In Iceland in 1783 a great flood of lava poured out through a fissure twenty miles long and only a few feet wide in places, and submerged the country for a distance of forty miles from the source.

Desmarest and Hutton showed basalt and granite to be rocks which had once been molten like lava, i.e., they were "igneous" rocks which had been pressed upwards into and, to a greater or less extent, through the earth's crust.

The emission of lava through the surface is merely one feature of igneous activity, the latter consisting essentially in the ascent of molten rock into the overlying crust.

With the advance of knowledge, it has become evident that by far the greater part of the planetary crust is composed of igneous rocks and of sediments mainly derived therefrom.

Igneous rocks are widely and extensively distributed over the globe, and igneous phenomena have manifested themselves in all eras from the beginning of geological time up to the present.

Sir A. Geikie enumerates six great epochs of igneous activity in the British Isles, viz., two Archaeozoic, two Palaeozoic and two Cainozoic, the Mesozoic era happening to fall within a period of lull.

Among the more remarkable records of volcanic activity may be mentioned the lava-floods which poured out in Tertiary times over areas extending from north-west Britain and Ireland to within the Arctic Circle. The lava now forms great plateaux of basalt in N. W. Scotland, Antrim, the Hebrides, Faroe, Iceland and Southern Greenland.

The great Pliocene lava-flood of Western America which Le Conte considered "among the most extraordinary in the world,"* covers an area of about 200,000 square miles, and has a thickness of from 700 to 3700 feet. The traps of the Deccan, poured out during the Cretaceous period, cover 200,000 square miles, the average thickness being about a mile.

*) J. Le Conte, 'On the Great Lava-flood of the West.' American Journ. Sci., 1874, p. 167.

Again, in a map, "South of the Amazon, Boué colours an area composed of rocks of this nature" — _i.e._ granitic — "as equal to that of Spain, France, Italy, part of Germany, and the British Islands, all conjoined." (Darwin, 'Origin of Species.')

In the north of England, the Great Whin Sill in the carboniferous limestone is estimated by Sir A. Geikie* to cover an area of 1000 square miles and to be on an average about 90 feet thick.

*) Sir A. Geikie, 'Ancient Volcanoes of Britain,' 2. p. 2. 1897.

The igneous rocks forming the base of the Archaean and said to be exposed over about one-fifth of the land area of the globe are thought to be a universal formation.

In a region included within the states of Colorado, Utah and Arizona there are curious isolated groups of mountains not connected with the ordinary orographic lines, and now known to have been elevated by the rising up of huge loaf-like masses of igneous rock which have failed to burst through the vast but plastic* pile of sedimentary strata formerly completely — and now partly — overlying them.* Denudation has exposed here and there the huge igneous bosses or laccolites, thereby revealing the secret of the origin of these exceptional mountains, which may in a sense be compared to aborted volcanoes.

The ocean floor is formed chiefly of nummulitic clay derived from igneous rocks (see Chapter 1).

The igneous rocks are masses of compounds of silica, in the form of silicates, in unconformable relation with sedimentary strata.

What, then, are these masses of silicates which from the beginning of the Archaean era have been bursting into and between the rocks above them, and erupting through and pouring over the surface of the land or ocean floor. What is their origin? Why have they been hot and plastic at one time in their history? and why have they shifted their position?

J. D. Dana writes in 1890*: "The origin of volcanic heat, the source of lava columns beneath the volcano, the cause of the ascensive force in the lava column, are subjects on which science has various opinions and no positive knowledge." Precisely the same statement would apply to igneous phenomena of which the volcanic are but a part.

*) 'Characteristics of volcanoes.' J. D. Dana, 1890, p.24.

With regard to the second of the three problems referred to by Dana, I hope to demonstrate that positive knowledge is now available concerning the source and origin of igneous material.

If that is so, it is reasonable to expect that some additional light may be thrown on the other two problems.

##### The Origin of the Igneous Rocks

Werner and his school believed lava, basalt and granite to be minerals precipitated from a universal ocean, the heated condition of lava being supposed to be due to burning coal-fields. Desmarest showed convincingly that basalt was simply an ancient lava, and that it got into position by flowing there as a molten rock, and not by being deposited as an aqueous sediment. Hutton proved that granite likewise was a once molten rock essentially similar to lava, but deep-seated. Accordingly lava, basalt, granite and their like are termed "igneous" rocks.

Some have regarded the earth as a molten globe with a solid crust, and the igneous rocks as up-wellings from the original still molten planetary magma: but according to physicists the globe must be as rigid as steel.

A view still held by many is that the original planetary material deep below the crust is at a temperature above normal melting-point but remains solid on account of pressure. When, perhaps owing to crust disturbances, pressure is relieved the rock melts and rises through the crust.

Some, again, have regarded igneous rocks as metamorphosed sediments. Gradations could, it was supposed, be traced from recent soft sediments, through less recent hard shales, sandstones, etc., to ancient very hard crystalline gneisses and schists, and on — by somewhat of a jump rather than a step — even to certain igneous rocks, "and thus we look in vain for the original material" (Le Conte), but it is the source of the original material that we are in search of.

The theory of organic origin held from time to time by a few "eccentrics," and usually dismissed as soon as mentioned is beyond any doubt the true one.

Organisms in igneous rocks have often been described (Appendix, Note G). Sometimes the supposed igneous rock is really a fossiliferous sedimentary one changed by igneous intrusions. Again the "organisms" may be "structural simulations."*

*) King and Rowney 'On the Serpentine of the Lizard.' Phil. Mag. (5) 1. 1876, p. 280.

Dr. Carpenter, an expert on the microscope and the highest authority on Foraminifera, mistook mineral for Foraminiferal structure in a very ancient serpentine limestone — not, it is true, an igneous rock, but containing materials akin to igneous. I, for my part, arrived at the truth almost by accident. In the course of examining certain fossils in connection with a problem in sponges, I drifted on to Eozoon, thence to the investigation of a Monte Somma (Eozonal) bomb, then to volcanic rocks in Porto Santo, and finally to igneous rocks in general. I continually found traces of nummulite shells. Although the truth was first discovered by direct observation, the fact of organic origin might have been, or rather, at the present day, might be suspected on (1) biological, (2) geological and (3) chemical grounds.

1) _Biological Considerations_

The earth is an ocean planet. Five-sevenths of its area is now covered by ocean, and the remaining two-sevenths has been submerged.

The ocean surface is rich in a simple siliceous flora and fauna, and the ocean floor over vast areas is carpeted with benthos and plankton calcareous remains. The Diatoms and the often symbiotic silica-secreting Radiolaria exist in sunshine and nutrient fluid, and have done so for aeons past.

The powers of multiplication are almost unlimited. One diatom dividing only once in twenty-four hours might have a billion descendants in a month.

It is not surprising that igneous rocks have been classified according to silica-content. The skeletons of silica sink to the bottom, dissolve* there, and become diffused through calcareous deposits. The silica replaces the lime of the little fossils in the same way as in larger fossils. (See postscript on p. 110.)

*) In 'Nummulosphere' 2 I wrote of siliceous skeletons forming centres whence silica was diffused, a residuum remaining as quartz. The supposed skeletons are nummulitic structures.

2) _Geological Considerations_

Immense accumulations of nummulite shells of Eocene age extend across N.W. Africa, Europe and Asia from Morocco to Japan.

Chalk is mainly an accumulation of nummulite shells of Cretaceous age. The soluble silica derived from sponges and plankton diffuses itself down through the mass of calcareous skeletons, replacing the carbonate of lime and forming lumps and layers of "flint" (chiefly silicified nummulites).

Most of the marine limestones from Eocene to Archaeozoic are nummulitic, even where macrozoic skeletons abound.

In very ancient Archaeozoic limestones, owing to the heat from intrusive dykes, the silica unites with magnesia, alumina, iron, etc., to form silicates in the form of pyroxenes.

The masses of pyroxene are often surrounded by a zone of banded limestone and serpentine ("Eozoon"). It is significant that these lumps and layers of silicate, which may be compared with lumps and layers of flint, have been mistaken for fragments of igneous rock projected in from intrusive magmas.* Even in Cretaceous and Jurassic limestones silica becomes silicate when heated, as in the Monte Somma bombs.

*) In this instance Daubenton's name is well bestowed: "Piroxène, c'est-à-dire, hôte ou étranger dans le domaine du feu." Haüy, 'Traité de Minéralogie' 3. p. 180.

Igneous rocks are very ancient highly metamorphosed nummulitic limestones from which naturally all the original calcium carbonate has gone, although a good deal of calcium and even some imprisoned carbonic acid may remain.

Iddings writes: "Calcium is one of the most abundant and wide-spread elements in igneous rocks, and enters into a great variety of compounds, the commonest of which are silicates."* The presence of calcalkalic felspars constitutes one of the chief characteristics of the great "Pacific petrographical province."*

*) 'Igneous Rocks' 1. p. 39. 1909.

C. Seven oxides, the chief constituents of igneous rocks (F. W. Clarke).

Silica | 59.87  
Alumina | 15.02  
Iron | 5.98  
Calcium | 4.79  
Magnesium | 4.06  
Sodium | 3.39  
Potassium | 2.93  
_Sum_ | 96.04  

_Remarks on the above tables_. — A. — Composition of sea-water. Silica occurs either uncombined or in combination with alumina, the silicate of alumina being finely suspended.

"Iron, easily detected directly" (Dittmar).

"Aluminium: in alumina" (Dittmar).

With the exception of gases fixed from the atmosphere there is reason to believe that everything solid comes from the sea. The igneous rocks are oceanic silicated deposits of nummulites, and the silica and silicate of alumina carried down from them by rivers return to their original source.

B. — Constituents of plankton and benthos organisms. Silica. According to Murray and Irvine* the silica-secreting organisms get that material, not from silica, which is only present in minute quantities, but from silicate of alumina finely suspended. Their culture-experiments showed that Diatoms flourished when fine clay was added. Amorphous silica was useless, but silicic acid jelly nutritious. At the present day the mechanically suspended silicate of alumina appears to be a fine sediment derived from igneous rocks. There was certainly a time when there were no igneous rocks, and probably an era when there were neither land nor rivers nor sediment. Did the first silica-secreting organisms get their silica from finely suspended silicate of alumina?

*) Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh, 18. p. 237, 1890-1.

Magnesium. Analysis of shells of two representatives of Nummulitidae contained 5 per cent, of magnesium carbonate (Brady). (Probably some of the magnesium in limestones is derived from calcareous algae.) (See also Appendix Note H.)

Willstätter* has shown that magnesium is present in chlorophyll, and not iron, as usually believed.

*) R. Willstätter. In Liebig's 'Annalen d. Chemie,' vol. 350, p. 65, 1906.

C. — Constituents of igneous rocks. All the constituents enumerated are present in the sea, and all except alumina are found in benthos and plankton organisms. The alumina may have been directly deposited from the sea. [The history of the discovery of the composition of Acantharia skeletons leads me to hazard the suggestion that possibly some of the 15.02 per cent, of alumina in igneous rocks may be due to an extinct race of plankton organisms. Acantharia skeletons were first thought tobe organic ('Acanthin,' Haeckel). Then Shevyakov believed them to be made of a double silicate of aluminium and calcium, and finally Bütschli discovered they were composed of sulphate of strontium. Who would have suspected these wonderful skeletons, which bear impress of the effect of aeons of evolution, to be composed of sulphate of strontium!]

_Metamorphism_

According to Aristotle we understand a thing when we see the cause of it. A knowledge of the origin of the igneous rocks and of the manner of accumulation of the materials composing them will throw light on problems of metamorphism. Igneous rocks are oceanic deposits of nummulites mineralized by silica, magnesium, aluminium, etc.

At the beginning of the chain there are sunlight, protoplasm and the minerals of the sea, and at the end a crystalline mass of silicates. What are the intervening links?

Limestones and silica (chalk and flint) may be indicated as the second link, and limestone with silicates (Eozoon) as the third. In link No. 3, heat of intrusive magmas has caused the silica to combine with magnesium, aluminium, iron, etc., to produce silicates* in the form of pyroxene: the peripheral banding is a mere detail. In the final stage, if limestone had been present, the carbonic acid would have gone and the calcium would have combined with the seven other chief oxides which form the crystalline mass of silicates. Limestone may have been replaced long before the igneous stage as in flint, phthanite, etc. The existence of silica-aluminium and ferro-magnesian groups of silicates is attributed to magmatic differentiation.

*) At first sight glauconite seems to be one of the silicates outside the igneous rock group, but perhaps this mineral should be regarded as an altered product of igneous rocks.

_Magmatic differentiation_

It may well seem incredible to a petrologist unfamiliar with biology and palaeontology that sunshine and living matter could be the parents of such a heterogeneous progeny as the igneous rocks. Yet the origin and metamorphoses of the bentho-plankton deposits known as "igneous rocks" are traceable. For some reason these very ancient mineralized organic deposits have become heated even above melting point. Chemical changes have thereby become greatly facilitated. The silicic acid with its four grades of acidity* has formed various compounds with the chief bases mentioned above. When the hot solid mass of silicates (or oxides) becomes liquid, the solid containing-walls constitute a reservoir. If the magma is pressed up through the overlying crust and through the surface it will flow out as a lava, with or without explosions and the formation of a cone of solid ejecta.

*) Ortho-, meta-, poly-, and di-silicic acid.

A certain sequence has been discovered in the character of the lavas erupted during successive phases in the "life-history" of a volcano.

"The general succession is from a rock of average composition through less silicious and more silicious ones to rocks extremely low in silica and others extremely high in silica — that is, the series commences with a mean and ends with extremes."* At Porto Santo, for instance, the black heavy basalt low in silica (basic) is covered by the pale-coloured light trachyte high in silica (acid). Both rocks must have come from the same reservoir. The chief differentiating cause is said to be temperature. The magma near the walls of the reservoir and its conduits is cooler than that in the centre.

*) Iddings. Bull. Phil. Soc. Washington, 12. p. 145. 1892.

"The chemical differentiation of igneous magmas, which appears to be due to so simple a cause as temperature in different parts of the magma, leads to an endless series of variations" (Iddings _l.c._ p. 164).

Igneous rocks of any particular district, however much they may differ from each other, yet generally show what Iddings terms a "consanguinity." Further, groups of districts forming some great "petrographical province" possess certain characteristics distinguishing them from the rocks of other provinces. Finally the igneous rocks as a whole are regarded by some eminent authorities as derivatives from some great primeval common magma.

Seeing that an oceanic organic deposit is parent of the igneous rocks, it is not surprising that traces of their common origin are discernible.

Variations in rate of cooling give rise to great differences in texture. Granite, rhyolite and an obsidian may have precisely the same chemical composition, but in the case of the volcanic glass the magma has cooled and set so quickly that the molecules have become fixed in position before they could marshal themselves in crystalline order. The slow-cooling granite, on the other hand, is a crystalline mass.

##### On the Source of the Heat of Molten Rocks

The interior of the earth must be in an intensely heated condition. Hot and boiling rocks, forced up from below, can actually be seen accumulating in heaps and pouring out in floods over the surface; and further, it is found that the temperature rises on an average 1° C. for every 32 metres of vertical descent into the earth.

This heat continually flowing out from within has naturally been regarded as part of the original stock of a cooling planet. The sky is crowded with glowing-hot bodies, and perhaps the earth was once in a similar condition. Even so, it does not follow that the heat _now_ escaping must be accounted for in this way.

When Lord Kelvin attempted to calculate the age of the earth on the basis of its having been a once-glowing but gradually cooling mass, he arrived at an estimate of 20 to 40 million years. The geologists protested that the time was wholly inadequate to account for the vast accumulation of sedimentary strata. The biologists, too, though ready "to set their clock" in accordance with Lord Kelvin's estimate if compelled to do so, were nevertheless inclined to suspect some flaw in his calculation.

Within the last twenty years a source of energy wholly unsuspected, but yet omnipresent, has been brought to light, viz., radioactivity.

Prof. Joly writes concerning the new science of radioactivity: "First definitely opened up in 1898 by Mme. and M. Curie, when polonium and radium were discovered, to-day we are in possession of established views in contradiction to the tenets of centuries."* It has been found that uranium is the parent of a series of substances, of which radium is one. The unstable atoms of these elements are undergoing disintegration and discharging energy, part of the latter being manifested as heat. Radioactive substances are universally distributed in the crust of the earth and in the ocean, but in varying amount. They are more abundant in igneous rocks than in sedimentary, in red clay than in _Globigerina_ ooze, in the land than in the ocean.

*) Joly. 'Radioactivity and Geology,' p. 1. 1909.

According to authorities who have studied the problems relating to the effects of radioactivity in geology, this form of energy is a source of the heat of the deep-seated igneous rocks.

The scaffolding of the earth's crust was formed in the ocean and out of seawater. Accordingly the general prevalence of radioactive matter in igneous rocks and in sediments derived from them, is what might be expected. The uranium entering the ocean along with the sediments from igneous rocks has only comeback to its original source. Prof. Joly estimates that 10<sup>6</sup> tonnes of radioactive substances have been received and again precipitated on to the ocean floor in the course of geological time. He writes:* "Presumably all this radioactive material has been at one time in solution or suspension in the ocean, whose waters, for all that we could have anticipated, might have possessed a content of radium some fifty times greater than the figures appear to indicate."

*) 'On the Radium-Content of Sea-Water.' Phil. Mag. (6) 18. p. 407. 1909.

The discovery of the origin and history of igneous rocks will lead, I believe, to a revival of the theory of chemical activity as an important source of the heat that has melted those rocks. Lord Kelvin preferred the view that "the earth is merely a warm chemically inert body." The inert masses of silicates constituting the igneous rocks, however, were at one time benthoplankton mixtures of silicic acid, alkalies, alkaline earths, oxides of iron, phosphates, sulphates, etc. The older and deeper zones of this mixture would be buried beneath a thick pile of strata and permeated with water and mineral solutions. A spark may set a forest ablaze. Heat arising locally in the deposit would hasten chemical activities all round, leading to ever-increasing accumulations of heat. The inert silicates of igneous rocks are the end term of a long series of changes, and may be compared to a spent conflagration.

Limestone seems inert, but the heat of a magma will cause the silica to combine with magnesium, etc., to form silicates as in the Canadian, Finland and Vesuvian "Eozoon"; and the heat of a kiln will make lime quick, the latter giving out heat when slaked.

##### On the Ascent of Molten Magmas

The deep-seated rocks, though at a temperature above normal melting-point would be solid owing to high pressure. Relief of pressure would cause them to melt and move in the direction of least resistance. If, as is stated, the nucleus of the earth contract more than the crust, the latter, owing to adjustment to a smaller radius, will be thrown into folds. The ascent of molten rocks through the overlying crust is characteristic of sinking areas; (Geikie).

##### On the Chronology of Igneous Rocks

Hitherto igneous rocks have not been allotted a chronological position proper to themselves. They have been regarded as primeval and beyond chronology, but nevertheless they are daughters of time. The date affixed is that of the strata into which they have been intruded, and, further, it has been the custom to regard the invaded overlying strata as older than the intrusive. Writing of the Laurentian granites, Chamberlinand Salisbury state,* "but it is now known that they are intrusive into the schist series. They are therefore younger than the latter." Now that the igneous rocks must take their place in the palaeontological series, the lower rocks will be regarded as the older and first formed.

*) 'Geology, Advanced Course' 2. p. 143. 1906.

An igneous rock has two dates, the first being its date of actual formation shell by shell in the ocean, and the second its time of uprising into the overlying crust.

##### Summary of Chapter 4 

The known crust of the earth is mainly a metamorphosed silicatic deposit of organic origin precipitated from the ocean. The deeper zones of this deposit are heated above their standard-pressure melting-points, but remain solid owing to high pressure. Crustal movements, due to shrinkage and adjustment have led to relief of pressure followed by melting, and uprise of the molten material along lines of least resistance.

The cause of the heating of "igneous" rocks is now being attributed to radioactivity. Radioactive elements are disseminated throughout the earth's crust and the ocean. Seeing that the lithosphere is a product of the ocean, the uranium family of elements diffused through the earth's crust must necessarily have had a similar source. Probably chemical activity has been an important source of the heat.

_Postscript, Note_ 1. — There are no authentic records of Diatom remains before the Carboniferous (Castracane). What are the reasons for assuming that the silica of igneous rocks is probably derived in part from Diatoms? Firstly, these rocks are seen to be deposits of marine shells. If the silica of the _immensely thick_ deposits did not come from the sea, where did it come from? Secondly, oceanic life at present depends on unicellular plants and especially on Diatoms, and there is no reason for assuming that a different relation held in the past.

_Note_ 2. — I have seen a recent shell of _Lagena marginata_ with Diatoms completely embedded in the wall. Here we have a picture in miniature of the great planetary deposit of silicated shells. It is doubtful whether sponges were accountable for much or any of the silica during the earliest era.

##### Meteorites

"We cannot but agree with the common opinion which regards meteorites as fragments broken from larger masses, and we cannot be satisfied without trying to imagine what were the antecedents of those masses." — Lord Kelvin.

"For there is almost as good a trade in exposing cosmogonies as in constructing them. But no special opprobrium attaches to failure, because everybody has failed, from Laplace down, or up, as you are pleased to consider." — P. Lowell.

Every now and again a strange and startling event happens; suddenly in the midst of a great light followed by a loud detonation something falls out of the sky and strikes the earth. No wonder such objects have been regarded with awe and veneration, and that temples have been built to enshrine these visible and tangible messengers from the invisible powers. The thunderbolt was the special appanage of high Jove. A stone in the temple of Apollo at Delphi, and also "Diana of the Ephesians" were probably sky stones. In B.C. 204 a black stone which had long been worshipped as Cybele the mother of the gods was removed from Phrygia to Rome with great ceremony, the guardians of the Sybilline Books having decreed that its presence was necessary for the safety of Rome.

In the wall of the Kaaba at Mecca is a sacred stone which for ages has been the omphalos of the Mohammedan world. According to scientific travellers the stone is probably a meteorite. Mohammed alleged it was a gift from the Angel Gabriel.

At the present day these rare and wonderful sky stones are the special objects of pride of our great Museums.

The evidence that meteorites have fallen from the heavens is now clear, as the following narratives, selected from many, may show.

"The oldest undoubted sky-stone still preserved is that which was long suspended by a chain from the vault of the choir of the parish church of Ensisheim in Elsass, and is now kept in the Rathhaus of that town. The following is a translated extract from a document which was preserved in the church:— 'On the 16th of November, 1492, a singular miracle happened: for between 11 and 12 in the forenoon, with a loud crash of thunder and a prolonged noise heard afar off, there fell in the town of Ensisheim a stone weighing 260 lbs. It was seen by a child to strike the ground in a field near the canton called Gisgaud, where it made a hole more than five feet deep. It was taken to the church as being a miraculous object. The noise was heard so distinctly at Lucerne, Villing and many other places, that in each of them it was thought that some houses had fallen. King Maximilian, who was then at Ensisheim, had the stone carried to the castle: after breaking off two pieces, one for the Duke Sigismund of Austria, and the other for himself, he forbade further damage, and ordered the stone to be suspended in the parish church.'"*

Again,

"About three o'clock in the afternoon of December 13, 1795, a labourer working near Wold Cottage, a few miles from Scarborough, in Yorkshire,* was terrified to see a stone fall about ten yards from where he was standing. The stone, weighing 56 lbs., was found to have gone through 12 inches of soil and 6 inches of solid chalk rock. No thunder, lightning, or luminous meteor accompanied the fall; but in the adjacent villages there was heard an explosion likened by the inhabitants to the firing of guns at sea, while in two of them the sounds were so distinct of something singular passing through the air towards Wold Cottage, that five or six people went to see if anything extraordinary had happened to the house or grounds. No stone presenting the same characters was known in the district. The stone is preserved in the Museum Collection."*

*) Copied from 'An Introduction to the Study of Meteorites,' 10th Edition, 1908. British Museum (Natural History), pp. 19, 22.

On September 13, 1902, a meteorite fell at Crumlin near Belfast. The evidence given below was gathered by Sir L. Fletcher on the spot and within about a fortnight of the occurrence.*

*) 'Nature,' Oct. 9, 1902, p. 578.

"At 10:30 A.M. on September 13, which was a cloudy morning, W. John Adams, who is in the employment of Mr. Walker at Crosshill farm, was gathering apples from a tree on the edge of the cornfield and near the house; he was startled by a noise of such a character that he thought it was due to the bursting of the boiler at the mill, which is about a mile to the south and situated near Crumlin railway station."

*) Copied from 'An Introduction to the Study of Meteorites,' 10th Edition, 1908. British Museum (Natural History), pp. 19, 22.

"Another loud noise like that of escaping steam, was followed by the sound as of an object striking the ground near by, and a cloud of dust immediately arose above the standing corn at a spot only twenty yards away from where he was at work. Adams ran through the corn towards the cloud of dust and found a hole in the soil; whereupon he hurried to the farmyard for a spade, and within a quarter of an hour of the fall had extracted a black, dense stone, which had penetrated the soil to the depth of one and a half feet and had been stopped by impact against a much larger terrestrial stone."

"The black stone was hot and, according to Mr. Walker, was still warm to the touch even an hour later. There was a sulphurous odour. Two other men were working at a haystack twenty yards further away from the hole made by the stone and also heard the sounds."

"The detonation was remarked at places five miles to the north, nine miles to the east, eleven miles to the south east, thirteen miles S.S.W. by south. Mrs. Walker said that some of the hearers had taken the sound to herald the arrival of the Day of Judgment."

"The stone weighs 9 lbs. 5½ oz.; it is 7½ inches long, 6½ inches wide, and 3½ inches thick. Its form is irregular and distinctly fragmental."

It is curious to reflect that the idea of stones falling from the sky was at one time ridiculed by the learned as a popular superstition, the objects in question being regarded by them as ordinary volcanic ejecta. When the truth became known, meteorites were regarded with special interest, but men of science still held very divergent opinions concerning the nature and origin of these bodies.

Meteorites are classed under three groups, viz. the purely metallic (siderites) composed mainly of iron alloyed with nickel, the siderolites composed of iron and stone and the aerolites or purely stony. The three groups belong to one class, for the stony pass by gradations into the purely metallic.

Meteorites are covered with a thin usually black crust due to fusion of the outer surface during the passage through the air, the interior being lighter in colour. Stony meteorites are usually friable, and can almost be crumbled between the fingers; sections show a granular glassy structure, with, in many cases, peculiar aggregations of granules (chondrules) having a radiating or reticulate pattern. The chondrules are said to be due to rapid crystallization.

The elements present in meteorites are the same as those known on earth, but some (e.g. phosphorus) occasionally exist in a free state, such as would be impossible under ordinary conditions on this planet.

Meteorites contain well-known terrestrial minerals, viz. olivine, felspar (oligoclase), etc.; and several which are unknown on earth, viz. troilite (proto-sulphide of iron), schreibersite (phosphide of iron and nickel), etc. They also contain gases occluded within their substance, viz. carbonic acid most abundant in aerolites, carbon monoxide abundant in siderites; also hydrogen, in greater volume in the former than in the latter.

The theories of origin of meteorites may roughly be grouped under three headings, viz.:
(1) Accretion of particles.  
(2) Fragments of a disrupted heavenly body.  
(3) Ejecta from volcanoes existing (_a_) on cosmical bodies outside the solar system; (_b_) on bodies within the solar system (excluding the earth); and (_c_) on the earth.

(1) _Accretion theories_. 

Dr. H. C. Sorby* believed that particles of matter at the solar surface were collected together by gravitation, fused into masses, and ejected during violent disturbances. Meteorites, then, according to this theory were portions of the sun.

*) 'Nature' 15. p. 497. 1877.

Arrhenius* believes that the sun and stars by means of radiation-pressure are continually driving out small particles of cosmic "dust" into space and that these become mutually attracted, thereby in time forming larger or smaller aggregates in the shape of cosmic dust and meteorites.

*) 'Worlds in the Making,' 1908. 'The Life of the Universe,' 1909.

"By the action of radiation pressure small globules (spherical drops of matter) condensed in the solar atmosphere are pushed away from the sun and wander through space with velocities perhaps nearly equal to that of light. It is not improbable that the strange messengers from other worlds, the so-called meteorites, are composed of such spherules which had been driven into space. The meteorites are distinguished by an entirely peculiar structure and composition, from all the rocks and minerals known on earth, from the so-called plutonic, which have been formed by the congelation of the liquid interior of the earth, as well as from the neptunic which have been formed upon the bottom of the sea." "These little drops which are ejected and propelled by the sun will collect chiefly in the external portions of the nebulae which owe their luminescence to the electrically charged dust. In the intense cold of the nebulae the drops will condense part of these gases, in particular the hydro-carbons and carbon monoxide, upon their surface. When such masses collide with one another they will be cemented by these materials. In this way small drops of spherules will grow into meteorites, which will continue their migration through space."

(2) _The "Cosmic catastrophe" theory_. 

According to P. Lowell* the solar system may have begun in a catastrophic approach of two dead and dark suns, not necessarily crashing into one another, but coming sufficiently close to set up tidal stresses resulting in each sun being torn into fragments.

*) 'The Evolution of Worlds.' 'Mars as the Abode of Life.'

There would be a big mass and lesser ones and tiny fragments. The large central and the lesser masses would become hot and nebulous from the mutual clashings. Consequently the very small residual fragments would represent a condition of things before the origin of the nebular phase of the solar system! "These things — the meteorites — are the oldest bits of matter we may ever touch." "Here the meteorites tell us of another, an earlier stage of our solar system, one that mounts back to before even the nebula arose to which we owe our birth."

"For the large body to whose dismemberment the meteorites were due can have been no other than the one whose cataclysmic shattering produced that very nebula which was for us the origin of things."

The meteorites "tell us of a nebula made up of meteorites out of which our planets were by agglomeration formed, and of which material they are the last ungathered remains, and they speak of times more remote, when our nebula was a cold sun."

_Note_. Plates 2C, 2D, 2E and 11 were done and printed off at an early period of the work. They include several useless photographs which could not well be eliminated later.

[Plate 2C: Figure 1](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2C-Figure1.png) — Nummulitid pillars and chambers of Orthophragmina pratti, 110x. Figure of no value here.

[Plate 2C: Figure 2](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2C-Figure2.png) — Section of Cornish Granite, 65x. Portion of a nummulite in horizontal aspect, showing region of central median plane. Section shows 3 furrowed marginal cords sloping down from west to east, and septa and alar prolongations at right angles to them. The lowest furrowed cord just above lower edge of photo shows over the middle an inverted V- or U-like septum about 20 mm. high, and the slit-like orifice of same just above cord. Note circular areas of dotted disks astride of cord, also convexity of cord from side to side. To see dotted circles or disks a lens 3x should be used, but photo will bear magnification of 10. After careful inspection, the picture (especially lower third) will be found to be crowded with details of organic structure.

[Plate 2D: Figure 10](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2D-Figure10.png) — Section of Eozoon, poor but showing in upper lighter part of photo a portion of a broad curved band of marginal cord with bases of septa across, and (under lens 3x) disk structures. 175x.

[Plate 2D: Figure 11](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2D-Figure11.png) — Cornish granite. Three marginal cords passing obliquely downwards from left to right and alars at right angles. I can see better by reversing figure. The curve of a broad ridged marginal cord can be followed from middle of the then right edge near circular patch. With lens 3x circular granular disks are clearly visible lying across cord, also faintly two fan-like septa with semicircular edge in oblique projection, 65x.

[Plate 2D: Figure 12](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2D-Figure12.png) — Cornish granite. Rhomboidal felspar crystal to left of centre shows ⅛ inch (3 mm.) above middle of lower left border and well between two parallel dark streaks a spiral rim (1 mm. diam.) with cog-like light and dark flecks. On left are two much larger concentric rims with radial "septa" and "alars." The upper dark streak, nearly tangential to inner of these, stabs five septa, 3x. Lens necessary.

[Plate 2D: Figure 13](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2D-Figure13.png) — Cornish granite. Photo poor but showing about centre of photo in oblique-vertical perspective three coils (respectively 2, 4 and 9 mm. in diameter) of central part of a shell; also radial septa ; second coil like a thick-rimmed ring. 6x.

The lighter circular area about an inch in diameter against upper part of right edge of photo shows beautifully the spiro-discoid structure, i.e. coils of miniature "marginal cord" with radial "septa" and "alars" in plane vertical to "parent" spiral. 260x.

[Plate 2E: Figure 18](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2E-Figure18.png) — Barbotan meteorite. Fragment of much-blasted nummulite. Orientation better found by making left border the lower. About centre is curved rim with circular lines of ridges and with bands across. Around left half are three or four septa and alars passing across a second cord near left upper corner. 65x.

[Plate 2E: Figure 19](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2E-Figure19.png) — "Wold Cottage" meteorite. Sections of portions of three nummulites. Below and to right trans. section showing striated gothic edge of spiral lamina, also coil of marginal cord in oblique projection.

The photo is from section shown on p. 254, fig. 38. Light and dark areas have precisely the same nummulitic structure; also there are disks partly on light partly on dark side of sharp dividing line. 110x.

*) Recently I have found that the photograph from which Fig. 39 was taken shows a nummulite very plainly when magnified only three diameters.

All from a slide in Nicholson's collection (P. 5869) figured in his monograph Plate 11, Fig. 16. Figs. 1, 2 are from the marked areas shown in Fig. 29 on p. 226. A lens 3x should be used. All 260x.

The whole slide shows nothing else than nummulitic shell structure throughout.

The photos were originally taken to show light and dark areas with continuity of structure throughout light and dark, thereby showing the light spaces could hardly be former polyp tubes filled in with calcite. Figs. 1, 2, represent each an area of 0.5 mm. (1/50 of an inch). Owing to the remarkable character of repetition on a continually increasing or diminishing scale, nummulitic structure has somewhat the same aspect under very low or very high powers. A very small area highly magnified may reveal a surprising amount of structure. Fig. 2 shows strands of curved marginal cord passing from side to side and "septa" of spirodisk from above downwards. Notice in central part of lower half of Fig. 2 a well-defined broad oval ring lying sideways. In the interior of the right end of the oval are six or seven very well-defined little disks in succession round the bend. Arches, bands and disks visible over the field.

There are portions of several nummulites visible in photo. The whole surface shows nothing but nummulitic structure, and every particle is in orderly arrangement, _i.e._ there is no débris. A marginal cord with septa curves round lower left corner within radius of 18 mm. Above middle of lower border are embracing gothic arches and a septum of shell in trans. section. (Lens 3x necessary for seeing details.)

[Plate 11: Figure 40](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure40.png) — Surface of flint, 8x. As in Fig. 39, but silicified. Nummulitic structure faintly visible over whole field. A marginal cord with septa curves upward obliquely in projection from left of centre of lower edge of photo to right of centre of upper edge.

[Plate 11: Figure 41](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure41.png) — _Eozoon canadense_, banded structure, 4x. Nummulitic structure is traceable both in light and dark bands, but with difficulty.

[Plate 11: Figure 42](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure42.png) — From section of Eozoon, and wrongly described in Nummulosphere Part 1 as a small nummulite shell. The dark gibbous area is really only a minute particle, 0.1 mm. in diameter, of a nummulite. The area shows disk structure especially along straight edge, and also septa astride of cord along upper left edge. 250x.

[Plate 11: Figure 43](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure43.png) — Rough surface of Cornish granite showing part of a marginal cord and embracing alar; also spirodisks single and in series. 4x. (Photo seen better reversed.)

[Plate 11: Figure 44](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure44.png) — Cornish granite. In upper left corner a septum in projection with "pans-pipe" rim, rising from banded cord; at lower left corner of photo part of another cord; disks fairly plentiful. 65x.

[Plate 12: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate12-FigureA.png) — Section of Portland oolite, 3½x. Concentric beaded bands of marginal cord and radial alars and septa of nummulites faintly visible over the whole field, but seen best in right half of upper left quadrant. The granules follow to a considerable extent the lines of nummulitic structure. (Low power lens necessary.)

[Plate 12: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate12-FigureB.png) — Section of Schlern dolomite, 4x. Marginal cord and septa of a nummulite. Many hours of the closest scrutiny are necessary to trace the nummulitic structure in this apparently structureless confusion. (Owing to increased experience since Plate 12 was done, I would now have little difficulty in rendering obvious the nummulitic nature of dolomite.)

[Plate 12: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate12-FigureC.png) — Dresden syenite, 4x. Nummulitic structure rather muzzy and confused, but abundant. In lower third marginal cords passing down obliquely from left to right with septa across. Within centre of right edge of photo, 3 mm. below lower edge of C, a disk 3 mm. across and with cogged rim, also three little dotted circles to left of disk. A disk in oblique perspective, 6 mm. diam., with left lower rim blacked out, is visible 18 mm. above centre of picture.

[Plate 13: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate13-FigureA.png) — Section of Totternhoe Stone (Lower Chalk), 110x. A curved band of marginal cord with septa extends from side to side across middle of field. (Picture too dark, and not equal to negative. It has been difficult to get good results from photos of any of the chalks.)

[Plate 13: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate13-FigureB.png) — Section of Melbourn Rock (Middle Chalk) to show circular and oval "spheres," 65x. These "bodies" are simply clarified areas in nummulitic rock. The areas are usually discoidal, and not spheres either whole or in section. Nummulitic structure exists in the clear spaces, and can often be traced from light to dark areas. (See also Plate 23 Fig. H.)

[Plate 13: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate13-FigureC.png) — Weathered surface of a lump of _Eozoon canadense_, i.e. of a mass of very ancient nummulites. Natural size. The external form and inner structure of the nummulites in various aspects are visible to unaided eye, or under lens 3x. They are best seen in lower half of picture, where one or two might almost serve for descriptions of species.

[Plate 15: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate15-FigureC.png) — Dresden syenite, 60x. Same view of a nummulite as in Fig. B.

[Plate 16: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate16-FigureA.png) — Stavropol meteorite. Section 5x, viewed by transmitted light.

[Plate 16: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate16-FigureB.png) — The same, 10x. (The central squarish black patch and two large white ones easily compare with the same in Fig. A.) Concentric — radial shell-structure and spirodiscoid structure fairly clear.

[Plate 16: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate16-FigureC.png) — A centre of a coil, 95x. (It is not certain whether this centre is that of a shell or of a spirodisk.) The furrowed band of marginal cord with coils winding at slightly different planes, with septa astride, and with smaller spirodisk structure is absolutely clear and indubitable after a little careful study with a lens.

[Plate 16: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate16-FigureD.png) — Centre of C, 1100x.

_Note_. — The Stavropol meteorite is a flat brick-shaped object about 5 by 4 inches in area and 2 inches thick. It was seen to fall on March 24 (o.s.), 1857, at 5 P.M. by a man working on a farm, and at a distance of about eighty yards, at Stavropol in the Caucasus. The specimen is in the Petrograd Museum. See H. Abich., Bull. Acad. Imp. Sci. St. Pétersbourg, tom. ii. 1860, p. 407. The photographs are those of a section made from a fragment in the British Museum (Nat. Hist.).

[Plate 17: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate17-FigureA.png) — Section of Snake River Basalt, 10x. Showing a slightly wider area than in Plate 14 A.

Careful study will show the ridged band of a "marginal cord" like a spirally wound motor-car tyre, with "septa" across. For guide to centre of coil see diagram.

[Plate 17: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate17-FigureB.png) — Mica 3½x. This wonderful photograph is crammed with details of nummulitic structure. The mica film was flaked off a thick block of dark amber-coloured Himalayan mica given to me by the great mica firm of Messrs. Wiggins. I have detected nummulitic structures even in the most transparent varieties of mineral by using the highest powers, but here the shell structure can be seen with a lens 3x. Spiral coils of marginal cord with septa and alars and spirodiscoid structures in all these are present over the whole field.

[Plate 19: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate19-FigureA.png) — Section of "Wold Cottage" meteorite, 4x. To left of middle of upper half of picture is a well-marked coil of marginal cord about two inches across and in slightly oblique perspective. Right half of coil shows (like a motor-car tyre) a curve from above down and also from side to side; parallel ridges well seen, also parts of septa across breadth, and spirodisks of which the whole shell is built. Within and nearly concentric with above coil is a smaller one near centre of the shell; and without and nearly concentric a much larger and less clearly denned marginal cord. The field where not too dark is crowded with nummulitic, including spirodisk structure (see, for instance, double band of disks crossing a marginal cord, just above centre of lower border of photograph).

[Plate 19: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate19-FigureB.png) — Section of Ensisheim meteorite, 4x. Nummulitic structure is abundant, but less clear than in the "Wold Cottage" meteorite.

[Plate 19: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate19-FigureC.png) — Dresden syenite. Section showing portions of broad band-like coils of marginal cord and also septa. 95x.

Crushed fragment in balsam, 65x. It can be said with entire certainty that the six or seven circular, oval or (U-shaped bands are parts of septa or marginal cords of nummulite shells (and not Radiolaria). The structure is obscured by the numerous Diatoms. When the eye is trained, it becomes possible to detect abundant spirodiscoid structure throughout. 65x.

[Plate 20: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate20-FigureB.png) — Red Clay (_Challenger_, St. 165, 2600 fms.). Crushed fragment in balsam 260x. In lighter areas nummulitic structure is visible. (The poor results in this figure led to the making of the excellent sections, of which photos are shown in Place 21 Figs. C, D.)

[Plate 20: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate20-FigureC.png) — Section of a hard chalk from Missenden, 4x. The whole field is full of nummulitic structure, viz., spiral coils of cord and the septa, but it is very difficult to make out. When magnified 12 diameters the section shows Globigerina and "spheres."

[Plate 20: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate20-FigureD.png) — Small diamond from Transvaal, 4x. Showing nummulitic structure.

[Plate 20: Figure E](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate20-FigureE.png) — The same diamond 260x. Portions of marginal cord, septa, and spirodisks are visible to the trained eye, especially above centre of lower edge of picture.

[Plate 21: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate21-FigureA.png) — Section of rotten trachyte permeated with sulphur from interior of upper crater of Tenerife, 4½x. The coils of a much-blasted nummulite in perpendicular section are visible to the trained vision. The rock section has a pale reddish tinge, the red being much more apparent in sections.

[Plate 21: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate21-FigureB.png) — The same 450x. Every particle of the rock section shows nummulitic structure. The portion here selected shows part of a coil of marginal cord. The part figured was chosen to compare with Tschermak's figure of the section of Seres meteorite showing antler-like crystal with a wedge of olivine (biologically, part of marginal cord and septum). In addition there are septa and spirodiscoid structures.

[Plate 21: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate21-FigureC.png) — Section of Red Clay (_Challenger_, St. 165, 2600 fms.). Showing portion of a nummulite, 10x. Best viewed by making left border the lower. Curved series of circular disks seen across the field. Patient study with lens affords a wonderful revelation.

[Plate 21: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate21-FigureD.png) — The same 260x. Shows coiled disk-structure, i.e. miniature marginal cord and septa.

_Note_. — This plate is one of the most interesting of the set. The sections were made from red clay and rotten trachyte hardened in balsam. The trachyte would have become red clay if it had fallen into the ocean. Red Clay comes from one universal deposit of mineralized nummulites. The "clay" may have been erupted from a submarine deep-seated part of the deposit, or from a supra-marine or upheaved area of the deposit, or lastly from the disintegrated surface of the deposit _in situ_.

[Plate 22: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureA.png) — Section of Radiolarian Chert, 10x. The figure within white square is shown magnified in B.

[Plate 22: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureB.png) — One of the Radiolaria, 450x. Figs. A, B, are not needed here, and would have been deleted had it not been inconvenient to do so.

[Plate 22: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureC.png) — Polished surface of Mazapil meteorite, 5x. The fine dotted or granular markings distinct from lines of the section or from cracks are here and there arranged in circular groups or defined curved bands.

[Plate 22: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureD.png) — The same as C, but 175x. Photographed by reflected light. Here the organic and nummulitic structure is unmistakably apparent to the trained eye. (Use of lens 3x desirable.)

[Plate 22: Figure E](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureE.png) — Surface of Jamestown meteorite, 5x. Showing outlines of nummulitic structure, 5x.

[Plate 22: Figure F](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureF.png) — Section of chalk (Upper chalk, Haling). Showing nummulitic structure, 450x. It is very difficult to secure good definition partly owing to halation. Fig. F, though poor, will well repay study. The negative was the best of many attempts.

[Plate 23: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureA.png) — _Nummulites laevigata_. Vertical section. Inter-pillar area of spiral lamina, showing the tubulated-striated appearance, and faint traces of spirodiscoid structure. 260x.

[Plate 23: Figure E](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureE.png) — Ehrenberg's granulated disklets from chalk, showing rings (the latter seen to be beaded under power of 350). 275x. Fig. E'. Other (smaller) examples of E, showing the beaded rings as solid disks (spirodisks). 2000x.

[Plate 23: Figure F](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureF.png) — "Morpholiths" such as shown in Fig. 5, p. 50; really a mass of spirodisks. 2500x.

[Plate 23: Figure G](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureG.png) — Two "canals" in Eozoon, showing granular serpentine to contain nummulitic structure continuous with similar fainter structure in the calcite. 450x.

[Plate 23: Figure H](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureH.png) — Melbourn Rock, showing "spheres" 450x. The edge of lowest sphere shows banded cord. Very careful study with lens 3x will reveal other coils and "septa," i.e. this "sphere" is a spirodisk.

_Note regarding Fig. "E," as marked on plate_. — E is the right half of the divided figure, and E' the left half (marked E on plate). See guide diagram.

[Plate 24: Figure H](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate24-FigureH.png) — Ganglion cells of grey matter of human brain. 1500x. The pictures are far too dark (and not so good as the negatives). The spirodisk structure is clearly visible in the preparations, for which I have to thank Dr. R. S. Trevor of the Pathological Laboratory, St. George's Hospital.

[Plate 24: Figure J](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate24-FigureJ.png) — Ganglion cells of grey matter of human brain. 1500x. The pictures are far too dark (and not so good as the negatives). The spirodisk structure is clearly visible in the preparations, for which I have to thank Dr. R. S. Trevor of the Pathological Laboratory, St. George's Hospital.

_Note_. — The above figures are best viewed under a strong light, and with a lens magnifying only 2 diameters (about 6-inch focus). 

If the pictures fail to convince — though C-G are fairly good — it is only necessary to examine, under oil immersion, any vegetable or animal cells or tissues to learn that the physical basis of life has a spirodiscoid structure.

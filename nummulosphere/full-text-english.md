"Be sure I will not swerve from the truth in aught that I say, nor deceive thee; but of all that the ancient one of the sea, whose speech is sooth, declared to me, not a word will I hide or keep from thee." — _Odyssey_ IV., 348-351.

#### Introduction

"What is wanted is, in fact, the skilled eye guided by a brain. _Hence the need of a long and patient training of the sense of sight_, attentive and reasoning observation of the phenomena to which it is directed, perfect sincerity, the entire abandonment of preconceived ideas, all united to a passionate love for science and truth." "A Day in the Moon," by the Abbé Th. Moreux, Director of the Bourges Observatory. [Transl.]

The foundations on which the stately edifice of modern geological science is supported are to a certain extent unsound, though easily to be made secure.

A discovery, and one, too, of a very simple nature, has recently been made, which will inevitably bring about a revolution in our ideas concerning the nature and origin of by far the greater part of the planetary crust, and will modify our conceptions even of cosmic evolution. The discovery referred to is that of the organic origin of igneous rocks and meteorites.

Huxley was fond of saying there seemed to be no limit to the possibilities of Nature, but at the present time to many men of science it seems inconceivable that white-hot volcanic lava, a lump of granite or a stony or iron meteorite could have originated in any degree from the action of living matter. Yet, as a result of many thousands of extremely careful observations, I am wholly certain that these bodies — at least, all which I have examined — primarily owe their existence to the agency of life, and moreover afford evidence of that agency, exactly as a mass of fossil shells or fossil skeletons of any sort bear witness to the former existence of the living organisms that made them. Only, in the case of the igneous rocks and meteorites, the fossil skeletons, owing to their peculiar shape and structure (see Chap. VIII.), have lost their individual outlines, and have become completely mineralized and, in some cases, ore-enriched.

The significance of the newly found facts will best be shown by means of a brief survey of certain matters of geological history.

##### Neptune _versus_ Pluto

In many parts of the world,* a traveller journeying from the coast or the plains, preferably along the course of a river, to some great range of mountains, will probably first meet with mud-flats, sands and gravels. On reaching the hills and outer zone of the mountain-massif, the rocks will perhaps be found arranged in more or less horizontal layers of shales, sandstones, conglomerates, limestones, etc., all of them evidently being hardened sediments or precipitates which, had formerly been laid down in water. The rocks forming the core of the mountain chain will be in steeply inclined layers of dense, finely-crystalline texture or in coarsely-crystalline unstratified masses. Lastly, active or extinct volcanoes, the sources of congealed rivers of once-molten rock, may be met with; and rocks resembling the volcanic will be seen as dykes or layers (sills) among the sedimentary rocks. Obviously the softer and looser sediments on the plains would be more recent than the more compact strata of sedimentary rocks higher up, the latter, again, being less ancient than the very dense crystalline rocks which they partly overlap on the flanks of the mountains.

*) See Appendix, Note F.

Werner (1749-1817), the renowned professor of mineralogy at the mining school of Freiberg in Saxony, classed the rocks of the earth's crust under four groups, viz., the primitive (granite, gneiss, schists, basalt, etc.); the secondary, or mainly sedimentary (shales, sandstones, limestones, "newer basalt," etc.); the recent, or relatively recent, diluvial deposits (clays, sands, gravels, etc.); and the volcanic. He taught that a universal ocean once covered the globe, even above the highest mountain-tops. The crystalline primitive rocks were _chemically_ precipitated from the waters, just as salt or alum might be thrown down from their saturated solutions. Granite, which frequently forms the core of great mountain chains, was supposed to constitute the primitive and universal foundation of the globe.

The waters of the ocean receded, either by evaporation or by being whisked off by some comet or other heavenly body, or possibly by disappearing into an excavation* in the globe. All the primitive layers being in place, the sedimentary strata now became deposited, mainly by _mechanical_ but partly by chemical means, in the agitated waters.* Volcanic eruptions were merely superficial recent and local phenomena due to combustion of deposits of coal or bitumen, the lava being a water-formed rock altered by heat.

*) Behälter, a reservoir.

*) For simplification, no mention is made above of "transition" rocks between primitive and secondary or Floetz.

So far, then, according to the opinion prevailing at that time, the earth's crust owed its origin solely to the agency of water, from which it had been chemically and mechanically precipitated.

A totally different view had been slowly maturing, however, and presently began to make its influence felt.

#### List of Plates and Figures
 
[Plate 1: Figure 1](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate1-Figure1.png) — Fragment of Diatom ooze, X 5 (_Challenger_), Southern Ocean St. 157, 1950 fms. This ooze (in the dried state) is a powdery mass of nummulites crammed with microscopic plankton skeletons, chiefly Diatoms. The faint circular or oval outlines of the nummulites are about 25 mm. (an inch) in diameter in the photo, i.e. about 5 mm. (1/5 inch) nat. size. [Nummulitic structure can be seen better in sections of this ooze hardened in balsam.]

[Plate 1: Figure 2](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate1-Figure2.png) — Fragment of Red Clay, _Challenger_ St. 165, 2600 fms., X 5 and 8, showing faint traces of nummulites. See Plate 21, Fig. C, D.

[Plate 1: Figure 3](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate1-Figure3.png) — Fragment of Red Clay, _Challenger_ St. 165, 2600 fms., X 5 and 8, showing faint traces of nummulites. See Plate 21, Fig. C, D.

[Plate 1: Figure 4](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate1-Figure4.png) — "_Girvanella problematica_" (from Nicholson's "type"), X 260. This "labyrinthine-tubular" pattern forms a dark patch in the midst of clear calcite. The whole section clear and opaque consists of nummulite shell-structure throughout. Coils of band-like furrowed marginal cord are very obscurely discernible, the outermost forming a broad oval band. Here and there indications of fan-like septa are visible; also spiral disk structure.

[Plate 1: Figure 5](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate1-Figure5.png) — Another patch with much larger "tubes," X 60. The "Girvanella" here forms a small speck in the midst of a coil of a nummulite, and is just visible under a lens X 10 when section is held up to light. Dark patch — hardly in Girvanella condition — in lower right corner shows fairly well a minute nummulitic spiral disk.

[Plate 2](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2-Figure.png) — A specimen of _Eozoon canadense_ or the Dawn Animal. Reduced two-thirds. [By viewing the above figure at some distance, or by holding up in front of a light to eliminate the aggressive banded pattern, it is possible to see here and there faint circular and oval outlines of shells.]

[Plate 2A: Figures A-D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2A-Figures.png) — Portions of Nummulites in Eozoon. Drawn from a section of _Eozoon canadense_. A, C X 30; B, D X 90. A — Centre of a shell showing several planes (in horizontal aspect). B — Fragment of marginal cord, alars and pillars. C — Two bands of marginal cord and radial alars. D — Portions of marginal cord.

[Plate 2B: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2B-FigureC.png) — Megalospheric shells of a related species, central median plane X 10.

_Note_. Plates 2C, 2D, 2E and 11 were done and printed off at an early period of the work. They include several useless photographs which could not well be eliminated later.

[Plate 2C: Figure 1](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2C-Figure1.png) — Nummulitid pillars and chambers of Orthophragmina pratti, X 110. Figure of no value here.

[Plate 2C: Figure 2](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2C-Figure2.png) — Section of Cornish Granite, X 65. Portion of a nummulite in horizontal aspect, showing region of central median plane. Section shows 3 furrowed marginal cords sloping down from west to east, and septa and alar prolongations at right angles to them. The lowest furrowed cord just above lower edge of photo shows over the middle an inverted V- or U-like septum about 20 mm. high, and the slit-like orifice of same just above cord. Note circular areas of dotted disks astride of cord, also convexity of cord from side to side. To see dotted circles or disks a lens X 3 should be used, but photo will bear magnification of 10. After careful inspection, the picture (especially lower third) will be found to be crowded with details of organic structure.

[Plate 2C: Figure 3](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2C-Figure3.png) — "Wold Cottage" meteorite. Portions of marginal cord with remains of septa astride, lying obliquely in lower half of photo. Compare with Fig. 2. X 260.

[Plate 2C: Figure 4](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2C-Figure4.png) — Particle from "Wold Cottage," at one time mistaken by me for Radiolarian; but is part of end of bundle of fine tubules; similar pattern later seen _in situ_ in Tertiary nummulite shells.

[Plate 2C: Figure 9](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2C-Figure9.png) — Chantonnay meteorite. Two parallel sets of dots (upper very faint) astride furrowed cord. Highly magnified.

[Plate 2D: Figure 10](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2D-Figure10.png) — Section of Eozoon, poor but showing in upper lighter part of photo a portion of a broad curved band of marginal cord with bases of septa across, and (under lens X 3) disk structures. X 175.

[Plate 2D: Figure 11](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2D-Figure11.png) — Cornish granite. Three marginal cords passing obliquely downwards from left to right and alars at right angles. I can see better by reversing figure. The curve of a broad ridged marginal cord can be followed from middle of the then right edge near circular patch. With lens X 3 circular granular disks are clearly visible lying across cord, also faintly two fan-like septa with semicircular edge in oblique projection, X 65.

[Plate 2D: Figure 12](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2D-Figure12.png) — Cornish granite. Rhomboidal felspar crystal to left of centre shows 1/8 inch (3 mm.) above middle of lower left border and well between two parallel dark streaks a spiral rim (1 mm. diam.) with cog-like light and dark flecks. On left are two much larger concentric rims with radial "septa" and "alars." The upper dark streak, nearly tangential to inner of these, stabs five septa, X 3. Lens necessary.

[Plate 2D: Figure 13](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2D-Figure13.png) — Cornish granite. Photo poor but showing about centre of photo in oblique-vertical perspective three coils (respectively 2, 4 and 9 mm. in diameter) of central part of a shell; also radial septa ; second coil like a thick-rimmed ring.

[Plate 2E: Figure 17](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2E-Figure17.png) — "Wold Cottage" meteorite. The lighter circular area about an inch in diameter against upper part of right edge of photo shows beautifully the spiro-discoid structure, i.e. coils of miniature "marginal cord" with radial "septa" and "alars" in plane vertical to "parent" spiral. X 260.

[Plate 2E: Figure 18](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2E-Figure18.png) — Barbotan meteorite. Fragment of much-blasted nummulite. Orientation better found by making left border the lower. About centre is curved rim with circular lines of ridges and with bands across. Around left half are three or four septa and alars passing across a second cord near left upper corner. X 65.

[Plate 2E: Figure 19](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2E-Figure19.png) — "Wold Cottage" meteorite. Sections of portions of three nummulites. Below and to right trans. section showing striated gothic edge of spiral lamina, also coil of marginal cord in oblique projection. In lower left quadrant a shell in perp. sect., and in upper left one in trans. sect. X 6.

[Plate 2E: Figure 20](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2E-Figure20.png) — "Wold Cottage." Dark patch. Poor, but showing traces of disk structure. X 2500.

[Plate 2E: Figure 21](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2E-Figure21.png) — Barbados Earth boiled at temp, of 1700° C to form a glass. Certain dark specks in the glass show distinct traces of nummulitic structure that have escaped solution. X 2500. (Barbados Earth is a deposit of siliceous nummulites rich in still undissolved Radiolaria.)

[Plate 2E: Figure 22](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2E-Figure22.png) — _Receptaculites neptuni_,* showing continuity of nummulitic structure in light and dark areas. The photo is from section shown on p. 254, fig. 38. Light and dark areas have precisely the same nummulitic structure; also there are disks partly on light partly on dark side of sharp dividing line. X 110.

*) Recently I have found that the photograph from which Fig. 39 was taken shows a nummulite very plainly when magnified only three diameters.

[Plate 3A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate3-Figure1.png) — "_Stromatopora concentrica_ Var. Colliculata." Specimens collected by the author at Gerolstein. One-third natural size.

[Plate 3B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate3-Figure.png) — _Stromatopora concentrica_, Goldfuss. Peroy Highley, del et lith. C. Hodges & Son. imp

[Plate 4: Figures 1](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate4-Figure1.png), [2](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate4-Figure2.png), [3](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate4-Figure3.png), [and 4](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate4-Figure4.png) — _Stromatopora concentrica_. All from a slide in Nicholson's collection (P. 5869) figured in his monograph Pl. 11, Fig. 16. Figs. 1, 2 are from the marked areas shown in Fig. 29 on p. 226. A lens X 3 should be used. All X 260.

The whole slide shows nothing else than nummulitic shell structure throughout.

The photos were originally taken to show light and dark areas with continuity of structure throughout light and dark, thereby showing the light spaces could hardly be former polyp tubes filled in with calcite. Figs. 1, 2, represent each an area of 0.5 mm. (1/50 of an inch). Owing to the remarkable character of repetition on a continually increasing or diminishing scale, nummulitic structure has somewhat the same aspect under very low or very high powers. A very small area highly magnified may reveal a surprising amount of structure. Fig. 2 shows strands of curved marginal cord passing from side to side and "septa" of spirodisk from above downwards. Notice in central part of lower half of Fig. 2 a well-defined broad oval ring lying sideways. In the interior of the right end of the oval are six or seven very well-defined little disks in succession round the bend. Arches, bands and disks visible over the field.

[Plate 11: Figure 39](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure39.png) — Surface of a piece of chalk from Haling, X 5. There are portions of several nummulites visible in photo. The whole surface shows nothing but nummulitic structure, and every particle is in orderly arrangement, i.e. there is no débris. A marginal cord with septa curves round lower left corner within radius of 18 mm. Above middle of lower border are embracing gothic arches and a septum of shell in trans. section. (Lens X 3 necessary for seeing details.)

[Plate 11: Figure 40](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure40.png) — Surface of flint, X 8. As in Fig. 39, but silicified. Nummulitic structure faintly visible over whole field. A marginal cord with septa curves upward obliquely in projection from left of centre of lower edge of photo to right of centre of upper edge.

[Plate 11: Figure 41](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure41.png) — _Eozoon canadense_, banded structure, X 4. Nummulitic structure is traceable both in light and dark bands, but with difficulty.

[Plate 11: Figure 42](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure42.png) — From section of Eozoon, and wrongly described in Nummulosphere Part 1 as a small nummulite shell. The dark gibbous area is really only a minute particle, 0.1 mm. in diameter, of a nummulite. The area shows disk structure especially along straight edge, and also septa astride of cord along upper left edge. X 250.

[Plate 11: Figure 43](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure43.png) — Rough surface of Cornish granite showing part of a marginal cord and embracing alar; also spirodisks single and in series. X 4. (Photo seen better reversed.)

[Plate 11: Figure 44](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure44.png) — Cornish granite. In upper left corner a septum in projection with "pans-pipe" rim, rising from banded cord; at lower left corner of photo part of another cord; disks fairly plentiful. X 65.

[Plate 11: Figure 45](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure45.png) — Cornish granite. A broad band of marginal cord extending across from S.E. to N.W. corner with two septa across and in projection; disks well shown. X 110. (Low-power lens should be used.)

[Plate 11: Figure 46](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure46.png) — Monte Somma bomb. Part of vitrified septum. For long a mystery to me, at first taken for Globigerina! Series of faint circles visible in projection round rim of large circle above. X 110.

[Plate 11: Figure 47](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure47.png) — Cornish granite. Good spirodisk in oblique projection in lower right corner. Lower of three radiating bands is probably the edge of a layer of spiral lamina. X 110.

[Plate 11: Figure 50](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure50.png) — One of several dark spots in a section of glass bead made by melting Barbados earth in electric furnace. Useless figure; better seen in Plate 2. E, Fig. 21.

[Plate 12: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate12-FigureA.png) — Section of Portland oolite, X 3 1/2. Concentric beaded bands of marginal cord and radial alars and septa of nummulites faintly visible over the whole field, but seen best in right half of upper left quadrant. The granules follow to a considerable extent the lines of nummulitic structure. (Low power lens necessary.)

[Plate 12: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate12-FigureB.png) — Section of Schlern dolomite, X 4. Marginal cord and septa of a nummulite. Many hours of the closest scrutiny are necessary to trace the nummulitic structure in this apparently structureless confusion. (Owing to increased experience since Plate 12 was done, I would now have little difficulty in rendering obvious the nummulitic nature of dolomite.)

[Plate 12: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate12-FigureC.png) — Dresden syenite, X 4. Nummulitic structure rather muzzy and confused, but abundant. In lower third marginal cords passing down obliquely from left to right with septa across. Within centre of right edge of photo, 3 mm. below lower edge of C, a disk 3 mm. across and with cogged rim, also three little dotted circles to left of disk. A disk in oblique perspective, 6 mm. diam., with left lower rim blacked out, is visible 18 mm. above centre of picture.

[Plate 13: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate13-FigureA.png) — Section of Totternhoe Stone (Lower Chalk), X 110. A curved band of marginal cord with septa extends from side to side across middle of field. (Picture too dark, and not equal to negative. It has been difficult to get good results from photos of any of the chalks.)

[Plate 13: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate13-FigureB.png) — Section of Melbourn Rock (Middle Chalk) to show circular and oval "spheres," X 65. These "bodies" are simply clarified areas in nummulitic rock. The areas are usually discoidal, and not spheres either whole or in section. Nummulitic structure exists in the clear spaces, and can often be traced from light to dark areas. (See also Pl. 23 Fig. H.)

[Plate 13: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate13-FigureC.png) — Weathered surface of a lump of _Eozoon canadense_, i.e. of a mass of very ancient nummulites. Natural size. The external form and inner structure of the nummulites in various aspects are visible to unaided eye, or under lens X 3. They are best seen in lower half of picture, where one or two might almost serve for descriptions of species.

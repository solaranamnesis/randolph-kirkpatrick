"Be sure I will not swerve from the truth in aught that I say, nor deceive thee; but of all that the ancient one of the sea, whose speech is sooth, declared to me, not a word will I hide or keep from thee." — _Odyssey_ IV., 348-351.

#### Introduction

"What is wanted is, in fact, the skilled eye guided by a brain. _Hence the need of a long and patient training of the sense of sight_, attentive and reasoning observation of the phenomena to which it is directed, perfect sincerity, the entire abandonment of preconceived ideas, all united to a passionate love for science and truth." "A Day in the Moon," by the Abbé Th. Moreux, Director of the Bourges Observatory. [Transl.]

The foundations on which the stately edifice of modern geological science is supported are to a certain extent unsound, though easily to be made secure.

A discovery, and one, too, of a very simple nature, has recently been made, which will inevitably bring about a revolution in our ideas concerning the nature and origin of by far the greater part of the planetary crust, and will modify our conceptions even of cosmic evolution. The discovery referred to is that of the organic origin of igneous rocks and meteorites.

Huxley was fond of saying there seemed to be no limit to the possibilities of Nature, but at the present time to many men of science it seems inconceivable that white-hot volcanic lava, a lump of granite or a stony or iron meteorite could have originated in any degree from the action of living matter. Yet, as a result of many thousands of extremely careful observations, I am wholly certain that these bodies — at least, all which I have examined — primarily owe their existence to the agency of life, and moreover afford evidence of that agency, exactly as a mass of fossil shells or fossil skeletons of any sort bear witness to the former existence of the living organisms that made them. Only, in the case of the igneous rocks and meteorites, the fossil skeletons, owing to their peculiar shape and structure (see Chap. VIII.), have lost their individual outlines, and have become completely mineralized and, in some cases, ore-enriched.

The significance of the newly found facts will best be shown by means of a brief survey of certain matters of geological history.

##### Neptune _versus_ Pluto

In many parts of the world,* a traveller journeying from the coast or the plains, preferably along the course of a river, to some great range of mountains, will probably first meet with mud-flats, sands and gravels. On reaching the hills and outer zone of the mountain-massif, the rocks will perhaps be found arranged in more or less horizontal layers of shales, sandstones, conglomerates, limestones, etc., all of them evidently being hardened sediments or precipitates which, had formerly been laid down in water. The rocks forming the core of the mountain chain will be in steeply inclined layers of dense, finely-crystalline texture or in coarsely-crystalline unstratified masses. Lastly, active or extinct volcanoes, the sources of congealed rivers of once-molten rock, may be met with; and rocks resembling the volcanic will be seen as dykes or layers (sills) among the sedimentary rocks. Obviously the softer and looser sediments on the plains would be more recent than the more compact strata of sedimentary rocks higher up, the latter, again, being less ancient than the very dense crystalline rocks which they partly overlap on the flanks of the mountains.

*) See Appendix, Note F.

Werner (1749-1817), the renowned professor of mineralogy at the mining school of Freiberg in Saxony, classed the rocks of the earth's crust under four groups, viz., the primitive (granite, gneiss, schists, basalt, etc.); the secondary, or mainly sedimentary (shales, sandstones, limestones, "newer basalt," etc.); the recent, or relatively recent, diluvial deposits (clays, sands, gravels, etc.); and the volcanic. He taught that a universal ocean once covered the globe, even above the highest mountain-tops. The crystalline primitive rocks were _chemically_ precipitated from the waters, just as salt or alum might be thrown down from their saturated solutions. Granite, which frequently forms the core of great mountain chains, was supposed to constitute the primitive and universal foundation of the globe.

The waters of the ocean receded, either by evaporation or by being whisked off by some comet or other heavenly body, or possibly by disappearing into an excavation* in the globe. All the primitive layers being in place, the sedimentary strata now became deposited, mainly by _mechanical_ but partly by chemical means, in the agitated waters.* Volcanic eruptions were merely superficial recent and local phenomena due to combustion of deposits of coal or bitumen, the lava being a water-formed rock altered by heat.

*) Behälter, a reservoir.

*) For simplification, no mention is made above of "transition" rocks between primitive and secondary or Floetz.

So far, then, according to the opinion prevailing at that time, the earth's crust owed its origin solely to the agency of water, from which it had been chemically and mechanically precipitated.

A totally different view had been slowly maturing, however, and presently began to make its influence felt.

#### List of Plates, Guide Diagrams, and Figures
 
[Plate 1: Figure 1](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate1-Figure1.png) — Fragment of Diatom ooze, 5x (_Challenger_), Southern Ocean St. 157, 1950 fms. This ooze (in the dried state) is a powdery mass of nummulites crammed with microscopic plankton skeletons, chiefly Diatoms. The faint circular or oval outlines of the nummulites are about 25 mm. (an inch) in diameter in the photo, i.e. about 5 mm. (⅕ inch) nat. size. [Nummulitic structure can be seen better in sections of this ooze hardened in balsam.]

[Plate 1: Figure 2](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate1-Figure2.png) — Fragment of Red Clay, _Challenger_ St. 165, 2600 fms., 5x and 8x, showing faint traces of nummulites. See Plate 21, Fig. C, D.

[Plate 1: Figure 3](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate1-Figure3.png) — Fragment of Red Clay, _Challenger_ St. 165, 2600 fms., 5x and 8x, showing faint traces of nummulites. See Plate 21, Fig. C, D.

[Plate 1: Figure 4](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate1-Figure4.png) — "_Girvanella problematica_" (from Nicholson's "type"), 260x. This "labyrinthine-tubular" pattern forms a dark patch in the midst of clear calcite. The whole section clear and opaque consists of nummulite shell-structure throughout. Coils of band-like furrowed marginal cord are very obscurely discernible, the outermost forming a broad oval band. Here and there indications of fan-like septa are visible; also spiral disk structure.

[Plate 1: Figure 5](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate1-Figure5.png) — Another patch with much larger "tubes," 60x. The "Girvanella" here forms a small speck in the midst of a coil of a nummulite, and is just visible under a lens 10x when section is held up to light. Dark patch — hardly in Girvanella condition — in lower right corner shows fairly well a minute nummulitic spiral disk.

[Plate 2](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2-Figure.png) — A specimen of _Eozoon canadense_ or the Dawn Animal. Reduced two-thirds. [By viewing the above figure at some distance, or by holding up in front of a light to eliminate the aggressive banded pattern, it is possible to see here and there faint circular and oval outlines of shells.]

[Plate 2A: Figures A-D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2A-Figures.png) — Portions of Nummulites in Eozoon. Drawn from a section of _Eozoon canadense_. A, C 30x; B, D 90x. A — Centre of a shell showing several planes (in horizontal aspect). B — Fragment of marginal cord, alars and pillars. C — Two bands of marginal cord and radial alars.

_Note_. Plates 2C, 2D, 2E and 11 were done and printed off at an early period of the work. They include several useless photographs which could not well be eliminated later.

[Plate 2C: Figure 1](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2C-Figure1.png) — Nummulitid pillars and chambers of Orthophragmina pratti, 110x. Figure of no value here.

[Plate 2C: Figure 2](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2C-Figure2.png) — Section of Cornish Granite, 65x. Portion of a nummulite in horizontal aspect, showing region of central median plane. Section shows 3 furrowed marginal cords sloping down from west to east, and septa and alar prolongations at right angles to them. The lowest furrowed cord just above lower edge of photo shows over the middle an inverted V- or U-like septum about 20 mm. high, and the slit-like orifice of same just above cord. Note circular areas of dotted disks astride of cord, also convexity of cord from side to side. To see dotted circles or disks a lens 3x should be used, but photo will bear magnification of 10. After careful inspection, the picture (especially lower third) will be found to be crowded with details of organic structure.

[Plate 2C: Figure 3](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2C-Figure3.png) — "Wold Cottage" meteorite. Portions of marginal cord with remains of septa astride, lying obliquely in lower half of photo. Compare with Fig. 2. 260x.

[Plate 2C: Figure 4](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2C-Figure4.png) — Particle from "Wold Cottage," at one time mistaken by me for Radiolarian; but is part of end of bundle of fine tubules; similar pattern later seen _in situ_ in Tertiary nummulite shells. 1500x.

Three marginal cords passing obliquely downwards from left to right and alars at right angles. I can see better by reversing figure. The curve of a broad ridged marginal cord can be followed from middle of the then right edge near circular patch. With lens 3x circular granular disks are clearly visible lying across cord, also faintly two fan-like septa with semicircular edge in oblique projection, 65x.

[Plate 2D: Figure 12](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2D-Figure12.png) — Cornish granite. Rhomboidal felspar crystal to left of centre shows ⅛ inch (3 mm.) above middle of lower left border and well between two parallel dark streaks a spiral rim (1 mm. diam.) with cog-like light and dark flecks. On left are two much larger concentric rims with radial "septa" and "alars." The upper dark streak, nearly tangential to inner of these, stabs five septa, 3x. Lens necessary.

[Plate 2D: Figure 13](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2D-Figure13.png) — Cornish granite. Photo poor but showing about centre of photo in oblique-vertical perspective three coils (respectively 2, 4 and 9 mm. in diameter) of central part of a shell; also radial septa ; second coil like a thick-rimmed ring. 6x.

[Plate 2E: Figure 17](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2E-Figure17.png) — "Wold Cottage" meteorite. The lighter circular area about an inch in diameter against upper part of right edge of photo shows beautifully the spiro-discoid structure, i.e. coils of miniature "marginal cord" with radial "septa" and "alars" in plane vertical to "parent" spiral. 260x.

[Plate 2E: Figure 18](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2E-Figure18.png) — Barbotan meteorite. Fragment of much-blasted nummulite. Orientation better found by making left border the lower. About centre is curved rim with circular lines of ridges and with bands across. Around left half are three or four septa and alars passing across a second cord near left upper corner. 65x.

[Plate 2E: Figure 19](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2E-Figure19.png) — "Wold Cottage" meteorite. Sections of portions of three nummulites. Below and to right trans. section showing striated gothic edge of spiral lamina, also coil of marginal cord in oblique projection. In lower left quadrant a shell in perp. sect., and in upper left one in trans. sect. 6x.

Certain dark specks in the glass show distinct traces of nummulitic structure that have escaped solution. 2500x. (Barbados Earth is a deposit of siliceous nummulites rich in still undissolved Radiolaria.)

[Plate 2E: Figure 22](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate2E-Figure22.png) — _Receptaculites neptuni_,* showing continuity of nummulitic structure in light and dark areas. The photo is from section shown on p. 254, fig. 38. Light and dark areas have precisely the same nummulitic structure; also there are disks partly on light partly on dark side of sharp dividing line. 110x.

*) Recently I have found that the photograph from which Fig. 39 was taken shows a nummulite very plainly when magnified only three diameters.

[Plate 3A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate3-Figure1.png) — "_Stromatopora concentrica_ Var. Colliculata." Specimens collected by the author at Gerolstein. One-third natural size.

[Plate 3B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate3-Figure.png) — _Stromatopora concentrica_, Goldfuss. Peroy Highley, del et lith. C. Hodges & Son. imp

[Plate 4: Figures 1](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate4-Figure1.png), [2](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate4-Figure2.png), [3](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate4-Figure3.png), [and 4](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate4-Figure4.png) — _Stromatopora concentrica_. All from a slide in Nicholson's collection (P. 5869) figured in his monograph Plate 11, Fig. 16. Figs. 1, 2 are from the marked areas shown in Fig. 29 on p. 226. A lens 3x should be used. All 260x.

The whole slide shows nothing else than nummulitic shell structure throughout.

The photos were originally taken to show light and dark areas with continuity of structure throughout light and dark, thereby showing the light spaces could hardly be former polyp tubes filled in with calcite. Figs. 1, 2, represent each an area of 0.5 mm. (1/50 of an inch). Owing to the remarkable character of repetition on a continually increasing or diminishing scale, nummulitic structure has somewhat the same aspect under very low or very high powers. A very small area highly magnified may reveal a surprising amount of structure. Fig. 2 shows strands of curved marginal cord passing from side to side and "septa" of spirodisk from above downwards. Notice in central part of lower half of Fig. 2 a well-defined broad oval ring lying sideways. In the interior of the right end of the oval are six or seven very well-defined little disks in succession round the bend. Arches, bands and disks visible over the field.

[Plate 11: Figure 39](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure39.png) — Surface of a piece of chalk from Haling, 5x. There are portions of several nummulites visible in photo. The whole surface shows nothing but nummulitic structure, and every particle is in orderly arrangement, i.e. there is no débris. A marginal cord with septa curves round lower left corner within radius of 18 mm. Above middle of lower border are embracing gothic arches and a septum of shell in trans. section. (Lens 3x necessary for seeing details.)

[Plate 11: Figure 40](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure40.png) — Surface of flint, 8x. As in Fig. 39, but silicified. Nummulitic structure faintly visible over whole field. A marginal cord with septa curves upward obliquely in projection from left of centre of lower edge of photo to right of centre of upper edge.

[Plate 11: Figure 41](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure41.png) — _Eozoon canadense_, banded structure, 4x. Nummulitic structure is traceable both in light and dark bands, but with difficulty.

[Plate 11: Figure 42](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure42.png) — From section of Eozoon, and wrongly described in Nummulosphere Part 1 as a small nummulite shell. The dark gibbous area is really only a minute particle, 0.1 mm. in diameter, of a nummulite. The area shows disk structure especially along straight edge, and also septa astride of cord along upper left edge. 250x.

[Plate 11: Figure 43](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure43.png) — Rough surface of Cornish granite showing part of a marginal cord and embracing alar; also spirodisks single and in series. 4x. (Photo seen better reversed.)

[Plate 11: Figure 44](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure44.png) — Cornish granite. In upper left corner a septum in projection with "pans-pipe" rim, rising from banded cord; at lower left corner of photo part of another cord; disks fairly plentiful. 65x.

A broad band of marginal cord extending across from S.E. to N.W. corner with two septa across and in projection; disks well shown. 110x. (Low-power lens should be used.)

[Plate 11: Figure 46](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure46.png) — Monte Somma bomb. Part of vitrified septum. For long a mystery to me, at first taken for Globigerina! Series of faint circles visible in projection round rim of large circle above. 110x.

[Plate 11: Figure 47](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate11-Figure47.png) — Cornish granite. Good spirodisk in oblique projection in lower right corner. Lower of three radiating bands is probably the edge of a layer of spiral lamina. 110x.

[Plate 12: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate12-FigureA.png) — Section of Portland oolite, 3½x. Concentric beaded bands of marginal cord and radial alars and septa of nummulites faintly visible over the whole field, but seen best in right half of upper left quadrant. The granules follow to a considerable extent the lines of nummulitic structure. (Low power lens necessary.)

[Plate 12: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate12-FigureB.png) — Section of Schlern dolomite, 4x. Marginal cord and septa of a nummulite. Many hours of the closest scrutiny are necessary to trace the nummulitic structure in this apparently structureless confusion. (Owing to increased experience since Plate 12 was done, I would now have little difficulty in rendering obvious the nummulitic nature of dolomite.)

[Plate 12: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate12-FigureC.png) — Dresden syenite, 4x. Nummulitic structure rather muzzy and confused, but abundant. In lower third marginal cords passing down obliquely from left to right with septa across. Within centre of right edge of photo, 3 mm. below lower edge of C, a disk 3 mm. across and with cogged rim, also three little dotted circles to left of disk. A disk in oblique perspective, 6 mm. diam., with left lower rim blacked out, is visible 18 mm. above centre of picture.

[Plate 13: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate13-FigureA.png) — Section of Totternhoe Stone (Lower Chalk), 110x. A curved band of marginal cord with septa extends from side to side across middle of field. (Picture too dark, and not equal to negative. It has been difficult to get good results from photos of any of the chalks.)

[Plate 13: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate13-FigureB.png) — Section of Melbourn Rock (Middle Chalk) to show circular and oval "spheres," 65x. These "bodies" are simply clarified areas in nummulitic rock. The areas are usually discoidal, and not spheres either whole or in section. Nummulitic structure exists in the clear spaces, and can often be traced from light to dark areas. (See also Plate 23 Fig. H.)

[Plate 13: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate13-FigureC.png) — Weathered surface of a lump of _Eozoon canadense_, i.e. of a mass of very ancient nummulites. Natural size. The external form and inner structure of the nummulites in various aspects are visible to unaided eye, or under lens 3x. They are best seen in lower half of picture, where one or two might almost serve for descriptions of species.

Coils of marginal cord, with septa of a nummulite. Parallel lines of cord with bands across, and dishes between septa are visible with a lens.

[Plate 15: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate15-FigureB.png) — _Nummulites laevigata_ (from Selsey). Perpendicular section (ground down), 20x. Showing two marginal cords, also septa.

[Plate 15: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate15-FigureC.png) — Dresden syenite, 60x. Same view of a nummulite as in Fig. B.

[Plate 16: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate16-FigureA.png) — Stavropol meteorite. Section 5x, viewed by transmitted light.

[Plate 16: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate16-FigureB.png) — The same, 10x. (The central squarish black patch and two large white ones easily compare with the same in Fig. A.) Concentric — radial shell-structure and spirodiscoid structure fairly clear.

[Plate 16: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate16-FigureC.png) — A centre of a coil, 95x. (It is not certain whether this centre is that of a shell or of a spirodisk.) The furrowed band of marginal cord with coils winding at slightly different planes, with septa astride, and with smaller spirodisk structure is absolutely clear and indubitable after a little careful study with a lens.

[Plate 16: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate16-FigureD.png) — Centre of C, 1100x.

_Note_. — The Stavropol meteorite is a flat brick-shaped object about 5 by 4 inches in area and 2 inches thick. It was seen to fall on March 24 (o.s.), 1857, at 5 P.M. by a man working on a farm, and at a distance of about eighty yards, at Stavropol in the Caucasus. The specimen is in the Petrograd Museum. See H. Abich., Bull. Acad. Imp. Sci. St. Pétersbourg, tom. ii. 1860, p. 407. The photographs are those of a section made from a fragment in the British Museum (Nat. Hist.).

[Plate 17: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate17-FigureA.png) — Section of Snake River Basalt, 10x. Showing a slightly wider area than in Plate 14 A.

Careful study will show the ridged band of a "marginal cord" like a spirally wound motor-car tyre, with "septa" across. For guide to centre of coil see diagram.

[Plate 17: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate17-FigureB.png) — Mica 3½x. This wonderful photograph is crammed with details of nummulitic structure. The mica film was flaked off a thick block of dark amber-coloured Himalayan mica given to me by the great mica firm of Messrs. Wiggins. I have detected nummulitic structures even in the most transparent varieties of mineral by using the highest powers, but here the shell structure can be seen with a lens 3x. Spiral coils of marginal cord with septa and alars and spirodiscoid structures in all these are present over the whole field.

[Plate 18: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate18-FigureA.png)

[Plate 18: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate18-FigureB.png)

[Plate 19: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate19-FigureA.png) — Section of "Wold Cottage" meteorite, 4x. To left of middle of upper half of picture is a well-marked coil of marginal cord about two inches across and in slightly oblique perspective. Right half of coil shows (like a motor-car tyre) a curve from above down and also from side to side; parallel ridges well seen, also parts of septa across breadth, and spirodisks of which the whole shell is built. Within and nearly concentric with above coil is a smaller one near centre of the shell; and without and nearly concentric a much larger and less clearly denned marginal cord. The field where not too dark is crowded with nummulitic, including spirodisk structure (see, for instance, double band of disks crossing a marginal cord, just above centre of lower border of photograph).

[Plate 19: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate19-FigureB.png) — Section of Ensisheim meteorite, 4x. Nummulitic structure is abundant, but less clear than in the "Wold Cottage" meteorite.

[Plate 19: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate19-FigureC.png) — Dresden syenite. Section showing portions of broad band-like coils of marginal cord and also septa. 95x.

[Plate 20: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate20-FigureA.png) — Diatom ooze (_Challenger_, St. 157 Southern Ocean, 1950 fms.). Crushed fragment in balsam, 65x. It can be said with entire certainty that the six or seven circular, oval or (U-shaped bands are parts of septa or marginal cords of nummulite shells (and not Radiolaria). The structure is obscured by the numerous Diatoms. When the eye is trained, it becomes possible to detect abundant spirodiscoid structure throughout. 65x.

[Plate 20: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate20-FigureB.png) — Red Clay (_Challenger_, St. 165, 2600 fms.). Crushed fragment in balsam 260x. In lighter areas nummulitic structure is visible. (The poor results in this figure led to the making of the excellent sections, of which photos are shown in Place 21 Figs. C, D.)

[Plate 20: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate20-FigureC.png) — Section of a hard chalk from Missenden, 4x. The whole field is full of nummulitic structure, viz., spiral coils of cord and the septa, but it is very difficult to make out. When magnified 12 diameters the section shows Globigerina and "spheres."

[Plate 20: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate20-FigureD.png) — Small diamond from Transvaal, 4x. Showing nummulitic structure.

[Plate 20: Figure E](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate20-FigureE.png) — The same diamond 260x. Portions of marginal cord, septa, and spirodisks are visible to the trained eye, especially above centre of lower edge of picture.

[Plate 21: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate21-FigureA.png) — Section of rotten trachyte permeated with sulphur from interior of upper crater of Tenerife, 4½x. The coils of a much-blasted nummulite in perpendicular section are visible to the trained vision. The rock section has a pale reddish tinge, the red being much more apparent in sections.

[Plate 21: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate21-FigureB.png) — The same 450x. Every particle of the rock section shows nummulitic structure. The portion here selected shows part of a coil of marginal cord. The part figured was chosen to compare with Tschermak's figure of the section of Seres meteorite showing antler-like crystal with a wedge of olivine (biologically, part of marginal cord and septum). In addition there are septa and spirodiscoid structures.

[Plate 21: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate21-FigureC.png) — Section of Red Clay (_Challenger_, St. 165, 2600 fms.). Showing portion of a nummulite, 10x. Best viewed by making left border the lower. Curved series of circular disks seen across the field. Patient study with lens affords a wonderful revelation.

[Plate 21: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate21-FigureD.png) — The same 260x. Shows coiled disk-structure, i.e. miniature marginal cord and septa.

_Note_. — This plate is one of the most interesting of the set. The sections were made from red clay and rotten trachyte hardened in balsam. The trachyte would have become red clay if it had fallen into the ocean. Red Clay comes from one universal deposit of mineralized nummulites. The "clay" may have been erupted from a submarine deep-seated part of the deposit, or from a supra-marine or upheaved area of the deposit, or lastly from the disintegrated surface of the deposit _in situ_.

[Plate 22: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureA.png) — Section of Radiolarian Chert, 10x. The figure within white square is shown magnified in B.

[Plate 22: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureB.png) — One of the Radiolaria, 450x. Figs. A, B, are not needed here, and would have been deleted had it not been inconvenient to do so.

[Plate 22: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureC.png) — Polished surface of Mazapil meteorite, 5x. The fine dotted or granular markings distinct from lines of the section or from cracks are here and there arranged in circular groups or defined curved bands.

[Plate 22: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureD.png) — The same as C, but 175x. Photographed by reflected light. Here the organic and nummulitic structure is unmistakably apparent to the trained eye. (Use of lens 3x desirable.)

[Plate 22: Figure E](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureE.png) — Surface of Jamestown meteorite, 5x. Showing outlines of nummulitic structure, 5x.

[Plate 22: Figure F](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate22-FigureF.png) — Section of chalk (Upper chalk, Haling). Showing nummulitic structure, 450x. It is very difficult to secure good definition partly owing to halation. Fig. F, though poor, will well repay study. The negative was the best of many attempts.

[Plate 23: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureA.png) — _Nummulites laevigata_. Vertical section. Inter-pillar area of spiral lamina, showing the tubulated-striated appearance, and faint traces of spirodiscoid structure. 260x.

[Plate 23: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureB.png) — _N. laevigata_. Section of a pillar showing faint traces of spirodiscoid structure in the supposed glassy structureless calcite. 1500x.

[Plate 23: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureC.png) — _N. laevigata_. Horizontal aspect of spiral lamina showing orifices of tubules. 260x.

[Plate 23: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureD.png) — As in C, but 1100x. Showing dotted granular structure and traces of spirodiscoid structure between tubules.

[Plate 23: Figure E](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureE.png) — Ehrenberg's granulated disklets from chalk, showing rings (the latter seen to be beaded under power of 350). 275x. Fig. E'. Other (smaller) examples of E, showing the beaded rings as solid disks (spirodisks). 2000x.

[Plate 23: Figure F](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureF.png) — "Morpholiths" such as shown in Fig. 5, p. 50; really a mass of spirodisks. 2500x.

[Plate 23: Figure G](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureG.png) — Two "canals" in Eozoon, showing granular serpentine to contain nummulitic structure continuous with similar fainter structure in the calcite. 450x.

[Plate 23: Figure H](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate23-FigureH.png) — Melbourn Rock, showing "spheres" 450x. The edge of lowest sphere shows banded cord. Very careful study with lens 3x will reveal other coils and "septa," i.e. this "sphere" is a spirodisk.

_Note regarding Fig. "E," as marked on plate_. — E is the right half of the divided figure, and E' the left half (marked E on plate). See guide diagram.

[Plate 24: Figure A](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate24-FigureA.png) — Growing root-tip of bean, stained with iron-haematoxylin. 2500x. At lower end of the great nucleus in B is a rouleau of three large spirodisks obliquely on edge.

[Plate 24: Figure B](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate24-FigureB.png) — Growing root-tip of bean, stained with iron-haematoxylin. 2500x. At lower end of the great nucleus in B is a rouleau of three large spirodisks obliquely on edge.

[Plate 24: Figure C](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate24-FigureC.png) — Growing root-tip of bean, stained with iron-haematoxylin. 1500x. Some of these figures show fairly well the spirodiscoid structure both in nucleus and cytoplasm.

[Plate 24: Figure D](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate24-FigureD.png) — Growing root-tip of bean, stained with iron-haematoxylin. 1500x. Some of these figures show fairly well the spirodiscoid structure both in nucleus and cytoplasm.

[Plate 24: Figure G](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate24-FigureG.png) — Growing root-tip of bean, stained with iron-haematoxylin. 1500. Some of these figures show fairly well the spirodiscoid structure both in nucleus and cytoplasm.

[Plate 24: Figure H](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate24-FigureH.png) — Ganglion cells of grey matter of human brain. 1500x. The pictures are far too dark (and not so good as the negatives). The spirodisk structure is clearly visible in the preparations, for which I have to thank Dr. R. S. Trevor of the Pathological Laboratory, St. George's Hospital.

[Plate 24: Figure J](https://cdn.solaranamnesis.com/RandolphKirkpatrick/Nummulosphere-Part3/Plate24-FigureJ.png) — Ganglion cells of grey matter of human brain. 1500x. The pictures are far too dark (and not so good as the negatives). The spirodisk structure is clearly visible in the preparations, for which I have to thank Dr. R. S. Trevor of the Pathological Laboratory, St. George's Hospital.

_Note_. — The above figures are best viewed under a strong light, and with a lens magnifying only 2 diameters (about 6-inch focus). 

If the pictures fail to convince — though C-G are fairly good — it is only necessary to examine, under oil immersion, any vegetable or animal cells or tissues to learn that the physical basis of life has a spirodiscoid structure.

[See p. 161.] I. Spirodisk in horizontal, and II., in vertical aspect. Each figure shows three orders of dimensions, viz., _a_, _b_, _c_, like, say, a cog-wheel with cog themselves cogged. If, again, _c_ were enlarged it also would show spirodisks with descending orders of size down to the limits of microscopic vision.
